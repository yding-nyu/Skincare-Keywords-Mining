Serums are the workhorses of the skincare regime because they are the most potent and permeable. Unlike other creams and salves, the molecules of serums are smaller and penetrate the skin at a deeper level, so it is imperative that they are applied before any other products. Moisturizers are key because they serve as emollients and maintain the moisture barrier of ones skin. Reach for your fave moisturizer AFTER you apply a serum.\\n\\xa0\\nHow do I choose a serum?\\nWe suggest you start with the biggest skin concern you have. Our skin is quite dynamic and can often offer up fine lines and blemishes at the same time. Its best to clear up the breakout with a targeted serum first before addressing the fine lines. However, sometimes, our dreams come true and ingredients like glycolic and retinol multi-task in one product! \\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nWhat’s Your #1 Skincare Concern?\\nAssess what’s currently going on in your life, and how your skin may be reacting.
