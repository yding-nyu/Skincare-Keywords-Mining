In fact, a quick search online shows that most people would rather wax, thread or go through laser procedure to remove unwanted hair than shave their face. But what if we tell you that there\u2019s another kind of \u201cshaving\u201d that not only removes unwanted peach fuzz from your face but also leaves your skin with a vibrant glow? Yup, you heard that right: It\u2019s called DERMAFLASHing. Inspired by an in-office exfoliating procedure called\u00a0dermaplaning, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_DERMAFLASH_504348.htm\">DERMAFLASH </a>is an at-home device that gently removes the outermost layer of the skin, including facial hair.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To give us more information about this trendy at-home device, we talked to DERMAFLASH founder Dara Levy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dara Levy:</strong> DERMAFLASH was inspired by the dermaplaning treatment and, accordingly, produces similar results. Dermaplaning is a manual exfoliating treatment that uses a sterile, surgical blade and removes dead skin cells, built-up debris as well as vellus hair. This medical-grade treatment is available only in doctor offices and medical spas and is performed by a physician, nurse or trained medical aesthetician. DERMAFLASH was born in the med spa that I own. After our med spa performed 6,000 dermaplaning treatments in 5 years, I realized an at-home solution did not exist and created DERMAFLASH. This device is powered by a subtle sonic vibration, which provides an elegant and comfortable treatment, while also enhancing the efficacy of the treatment. It has multiple safety features built in.\u00a0 The blade in our Edge is covered by a safety cage that ensures a safe, smooth result.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I say this all the time: Men shave, women flash. It\u2019s important to note that DERMAFLASH is not a shaver, it\u2019s an exfoliant that also removes peach fuzz. Men grow terminal hair, which is like a piece of copper wire.\u00a0 Women grow vellus hair, which is light and fluffy. \u00a0The blade in our Edge was designed specifically for the delicate skin on a woman\u2019s face. It is counter-intuitive for a woman to use a product designed for the tough skin and hair of a man.\u00a0 The blades in a man\u2019s razor are sharp and much too harsh for a woman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another difference is that men have to lubricate their beards to make them receptive to removal. DERMAFLASH is performed on a perfectly dry canvas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For one, microdermabrasion also doesn\u2019t offer hair removal. Microdermabrasion is an exfoliating treatment that uses suction and abrasive crystals.\u00a0 Results are lovely for some, but for many, the treatment can be too aggressive and can result in redness, swelling and small bruises. It is also not recommended for people who have rosacea or are prone to broken capillaries\u00a0There are certain risks associated with the treatment as well, most are associated with performing microdermabrasion under unsterile conditions. Patients are at risk of contracting infections if the microdermabrasion applicator and vacuum are not properly sanitized. Also if the machine is used at too high a strength, there is a risk that the patient\u2019s skin may be perforated by the fine crystals that are used to exfoliate the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DERMAFLASH is the ONLY device on the market that both exfoliates and removes peach fuzz.\u00a0 There is no downtime and results are immediate. DERMAFLASH does not promote an inflammatory response, as it does not involve the use of harsh chemicals, granular crystals or suction.\u00a0 DERMAFLASH creates a flawless canvas for makeup and allows skin-care to do its job more effectively.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DERMAFLASH was designed as a once per week treatment. As long as you follow the directions you are good to glow!\u00a0After your first Flash, you will be amazed by how smooth and radiant your skin looks and feels.\u00a0 Product penetration is enhanced and makeup glides on beautifully.\u00a0 Light is refracted, rather than absorbed, producing a beautiful glow.\u00a0 All of this occurs because you have removed the barrier lying on top of the skin\u2019s surface.</p>"},

Eczema (a.k.a. atopic dermatitis) is a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-eczema/\">chronic skin condition</a> that causes a dry, scaly, itchy rash\u2014and the dry air of winter can exacerbate your symptoms. While there is currently no cure for eczema, diligent use of balms, creams and even shampoos </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can help soothe your skin and ease your eczema symptoms. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about how to choose the right skin care product for you\u2014as well as how to take care of eczema-prone skin\u2014we talked to the experts at <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_First+Aid+Beauty_502325.htm\">First Aid Beauty</a>.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue most products pose for eczema sufferers is that they have the potential to further irritate already fragile skin. Choosing products specifically formulated to treat the symptoms of eczema and that are gentle and fragrance-free is extremely important.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best moisturizers for eczema help to seal moisture in the skin and contain colloidal oatmeal, an FDA-designated ingredient for treating the discomfort associated with eczema. Absolutely avoid ingredients such as alcohol and perfume that can trigger flare-ups. The experts at First Aid Beauty add, \u201cOur hero product, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Ultra+Repair+Cream_47444.htm\">Ultra Repair Cream</a>, is a head-to-toe moisturizer that delivers exceptional hydration while helping provide immediate relief and long-lasting protection for dry, distressed skin, even eczema.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for products with ingredients like colloidal oatmeal, shea butter, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a> and ceramides\u2014these moisturizing ingredients repair and protect the skin and relieve itching and irritation. Colloidal oatmeal specifically is an FDA-designated skin protectant that relieves itching and minor irritation caused by eczema, rashes and other skin conditions. Avoid fragrances, harsh ingredients and alcohol-based products as they can trigger flare-ups and dry out skin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you have eczema, psoriasis or keratosis pilaris (also known as \u201cchicken skin\u201d), consider this cream your one-stop shop for helping to alleviate symptoms. This reparative cream is formulated with oatmeal extract to prevent flaking and dryness, antioxidants to protect against free radical damage, allantoin to soothe irritation and eucalyptus oil to curb inflammation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dermstore shoppers particularly love using this cream during colder weather because of its thick, rich texture. \u201cI love this in the winter when I need a heavier cream for my face,\u201d writes one Dermstore shopper.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s not surprising that Dermstore customers rave about this fragrance-free cream. After all, it\u2019s formulated with super-soothing ingredients including Avene\u2019s renowned thermal spring water, as well as evening primrose oil.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThis moisturizer protects my dry skin from the brutal effects of winter,\u201d writes one Dermstore shopper. Another reviewer adds, \u201cI have very sensitive skin and often break out. I have tried other products and none seemed to work until I tried this one. It goes on very smoothly and it is unscented.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s a reason why this thick, rich body cream is such a fan favorite. In addition to being chock-full of moisturizing agents like glycerin and petrolatum, it also contains antioxidants to protect skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One Dermstore reviewer comments, \u201cI have found this cream to be extremely effective at hydrating very dry skin. The cream is very light and absorbs quickly into the skin. In the winter, I use this instead of lotion. The rest of the year I use this on problem areas like feet and elbows.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Talk about a multitasker: This balm calms irritation and redness from eczema, nourishes chapped lips, heals burns and scrapes, allows tattoos to heal and can even be used to tame frizzies. Dr. Heather D. Rogers, M.D., dermatologist and founder of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Doctor+Rogers+RESTORE_504931.htm\">Doctor Rogers RESTORE</a>, explains why this balm is such a great pick for eczema: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/castor-oil-skin-benefits/\">castor seed oil</a> is a natural anti-inflammatory. The castor wax provides a layer of protection and glycerin aids in healing skin. It is natural, plant-based, hypoallergenic, safe for all ages and recommended by dermatologists.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And Dermstore customers agree, with one customer stating,\u00a0\u201cThis is a great natural balm that is super hydrating. I can feel it immediately sinking into skin and no irritation whatsoever.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For signs of eczema, Dr. Rogers recommends applying it to your patches twice a day for a week, then nightly for another week (if you still need to). \u201cBecause it does not have water or alcohol in it, it will not sting, even on open or fissured areas,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cWhen skin is clear, mix the RESTORE healing balm with your favorite moisturizer and apply to your eczema-prone areas once a day to prevent future flare-ups,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to providing superior sun protection, EltaMD also delivers long-lasting moisture to inflamed and flaky skin. Free of fragrances, parabens and preservatives, this waterless moisturizer\u00a0works to bring relief to eczema, sunburn and even post-procedure skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Dermstore customer\u2019s review says it all: \u201cWe\u2019ve tried numerous moisturizers for my son who has severe eczema, and this [is] hands-down the best. Easy to spread and skin absorbs it well. Stays moisturized most of [the] day.\u201d</p>"},

A mascara might claim to offer insane volume but could very well leave your lashes dry and flaky. That\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to read reviews before turning over any of your hard-earned dough. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here at Dermstore, we sell products that shoppers keep purchasing again and again, from brands that are otherwise only sold at dermatologist offices to lines that are exclusive to spas and salons to indie brands that are about to be the next big thing. Some are such cult favorites that shoppers consistently give them a whopping 5-star mark. Want to know which beauty products got the top scores this year? Here are our 15 most-reviewed products (at the time of publication)\u2014and why Dermstore shoppers think you should give them a spot in your beauty routine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With 1,400+ reviews, this sunscreen is <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/eltamd-uv-clear-sunscreen-review/\">beloved by Dermstore shoppers</a>\u2014and for good reason. Some sunscreens are greasy\u2014but not this one, which was specially designed for acne-prone skin. This clear SPF protects against UVA and UVB rays and is formulated with moisturizing hyaluronic acid and pore-clearing lactic acid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWears great on its own or under makeup. Even though it is very emollient and moisturizing it does not cause excess oil, and I often find myself skipping or not needing foundation since I started using this sunscreen,\u201d writes one Dermstore shopper. Another customer calls this product \u201cthe best sunscreen I have ever used\u201d and love the fact that \u201cit\u2019s lightweight, absorbs really well and does not leave an obvious white layer on the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antioxidants like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a> are a skin care must. After all, they protect your skin from free radicals, which can damage skin and lead to wrinkles. Enter this <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-superproduct-skinceuticals-c-e-ferulic/\">super-potent antioxidant serum</a> which showcases vitamin C to brighten and protect skin, vitamin E to boost skin\u2019s moisture barrier and ferulic acid to boost the effects of both vitamins. With 1,050+ reviews, this serum has a huge following.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As one Dermstore shopper puts it: \u201cThis is everything you want in a vitamin C serum ingredients wise.\u201d Another Dermstore shopper calls this serum \u201cmagic in a bottle,\u201d and writes: \u201cI was skeptical in the beginning due to the high cost but I was ready to do anything to fix my skin! I\u2019ve been using SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic for a week now and I\u2019ve seen a DRASTIC fading of acne spots.\u201d Another review even says, \u201cI love this! I use it every day and when I don\u2019t, I notice a difference. It brightens my skin and I always get compliments on it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cleansing oils are all the rage these days and DHC\u2019s version is one of the most popular. In fact, it\u2019s been reviewed 590+ times! With <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/olive-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">olive oil</a> and vitamin E, this cleansing oil removes makeup, dirt and other impurities without leaving skin greasy. \u201cI love this cleansing oil. It works really well to remove any makeup and dirt and even unclogs pores,\u201d says one Dermstore shopper. \u201cMy face feels hydrated and super clean after using this.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many Dermstore reviewers say they use this cleansing oil as the first step in a double cleanse. One such reviewer writes about this cleansing oil: \u201cIt is the first step in my 2-step cleansing process. It does a great job removing my makeup and sunscreen. It is gentle on my sensitive skin, leaving no residue after using my cleanser. Highly recommend this product.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you\u2019re dealing with both acne and signs of aging, it might feel like there\u2019s no one product that addresses both. The thing is, this cleanser does exactly that, so it makes sense that 570+ Dermstore shoppers have left reviews. Formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">glycolic acid</a>, this cleanser resurfaces skin for a clearer, smoother complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have used this cleanser exclusively for the past year,\u201d writes one Dermstore customer. \u201cIt is mild, not drying, and leaves my skin clear. I have never been prone to breakouts, but do have the occasional whitehead and those have basically disappeared.\u201d Another Dermstore shopper shares, \u201cThis cleanser is great for sensitive skin. It works really well without irritation. It thoroughly cleanses and moisturizes.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most exfoliators aren\u2019t gentle enough for daily use, but this one is, so it makes sense that it gets a ton of love from Dermstore customers. In fact, it\u2019s been reviewed 400+ times. There aren\u2019t any harsh granules in this product. Instead, it utilizes a rice-based enzyme powder to gently exfoliate skin and leave it looking brighter and feeling smoother. The daily exfoliator is activated when you add water to it and salicylic acid is released to do the job of exfoliating. There are also brightening ingredients like grapefruit and soothing ingredients like colloidal oatmeal in the formula.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI\u2019ve used this almost daily for over ten years as a follow-up to my regular face-washing routine,\u201d writes one Dermstore customer. \u201cIt\u2019s great for removing any residual dirt and especially for soap-resistant sunscreen. Important product at home and on the road!\u201d Another shopper adds, \u201cLove, love, love the product! Very effective yet mild. My skin feels clean, smooth and soft after use.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from its gorgeous mint-green exterior and quick-drying power? This award-winning masterpiece was created by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hair-questions-with-stylist-harry-josh/\">Harry Josh</a>, one of the most sought-after editorial hairstylists in the world and the hairstylist behind some of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/celebrity-favorite-hair-dryer/\">the most famous manes</a> on the runway and the red carpet. And because it\u2019s been featured several times on magazines and on A-list celebrities\u2019 Instagram feeds, it\u2019s no wonder it\u2019s been reviewed more than 380 times.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cBest hair dryer by far!\u201d raves one Dermstore reviewer. \u201cDefinitely an investment piece but one that pays off. It dries my long layered hair in 10 to 15 minutes at most while keeping each individual fine and delicate strand healthy and shiny.\u201d Another Dermstore shopper says, \u201cThe speed of this dryer is fantastic, but what really got me what the ionizing feature, which made my hair noticeably shinier and smoother.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clocking in at 175+ reviews, this dry shampoo spray is a hair care fave among Dermstore shoppers. It sops up grease in a flash, imparting a soft touch to roots. Plus, the oat milk in the formula smooths hair.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI\u2019ve used many dry shampoos and this is among the best,\u201d writes one Dermstore reviewer. \u201cIt leaves my hair looking, feeling and smelling clean those days in between washes. It doesn\u2019t leave my hair with a gritty residue and it doesn\u2019t weigh it down.\u201d Another Dermstore reviewer has this to say: \u201cI have tried a few dry shampoos but this is definitely the BEST one. It doesn\u2019t irritate my dry scalp and it really helps turn my hair from an oily mess to soft and clean-feeling.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking to build volume, look no further than this styling spray, which has been reviewed more than a 119 times. Bonus: It\u2019s packed with good-for-your-hair ingredients like panthenol to moisturize your mane while locking in style. (No stiff crunchiness here!)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cGreat volumizer for my fine, limp hair,\u201d writes one Dermstore customer. \u201cHolds my hair in place and stays soft and movable all day!\u201d Another Dermstore customer says this has been their go-to hairspray for years. \u201cI have found that it holds my hairstyle as long as I need it to and my hair remains soft,\u201d writes the customer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those with uber-sensitive skin, turn your attention to this gentle shampoo, which has been reviewed 103 times. Designed for the most sensitive scalps, this shampoo is free of harsh detergents that can cause irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAlthough a bit skeptical about [the] product at first, this has turned out to be [the] best shampoo I have ever used,\u201d writes one Dermstore customer. Another customer elaborates on why they\u2019ll keep recommending this shampoo: \u201cNo more fear of shampoo chemicals causing skin eruptions. I am thrilled to have found a comfortable and affordable solution.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heat tools often cause damage, but not this one. That\u2019s why it\u2019s been reviewed nearly 80 times. Simply brush dry hair slowly to straighten it without causing damage. Whether you have wavy, curly or frizzy hair, you\u2019ll see results, say Dermstore customers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have enormous curly, frizzy hair,\u201d writes one Dermstore customer. \u201cI have used [a] blow dryer and round brush, flat irons, curling irons, heated brushes, all kind of hair-straightening contraptions and nothing has ever beaten my hair into soft, shiny, straight submission until DAFNI! This brush is the most incredible invention ever.\u201d Adds another Dermstore shopper, \u201cI have extremely thick, wavy hair, so I have always hated straightening it due to the time it takes. This brush has made straightening my hair so much faster and easier! I love it!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have very sensitive skin and every other eyelash enhancer that I have tried would leave my eyes red, raw and burning,\u201d writes one reviewer. \u201cThis gave results within two weeks and does not irritate my eyes at all.\u201d Another Dermstore customer says they don\u2019t have to use mascara because of this product. \u201cI apply it morning and night and it keeps my [eyelashes] healthy and thick and long,\u201d they write. \u201cI don\u2019t wear mascara and I never have and this product ensures that I can continue that trend!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want your foundation to look its best, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-primer-and-what-does-it-do/\">applying a primer</a> underneath is a must.

It does not break me out and has improved my skin tone. Absorbs completely without leaving an oily feel to your skin.\u201d Adds another, \u201cThis is a wonderful alternative to tinted sunscreen! I use this all over and then brush on the loose powder sunscreen! Clean formula. I have problematic skin and this product does not cause any irritation or breakouts.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With 190+ reviews, this is another primer that our shoppers can\u2019t get enough of. Its gel texture smooths fine lines and pores and also keeps oiliness at bay. Plus, it\u2019s formulated with skin-softening olive oil.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One Dermstore customer raves, \u201cIt\u2019s true! Makeup glides on and stays. There is NO drying effect. It seems to fill the fine lines so the makeup doesn\u2019t cake.\u201d Another Dermstore shopper writes, \u201cVelvet Skin Coat keeps my face looking matte without looking or feeling dry. It also evens tone and minimizes pores. I use this over my moisturizer and [my] skin feels totally comfortable. Also, this has no fragrance and washes off easily.

This foundation is the only makeup that both hides and heals my skin imperfections. I\u2019m finally willing to show my face again.\u201d Another reviewer adds, \u201cI have been using this powder for years and I will not use any other powder. I have acne-prone skin and this powder is perfect for light daily use. It does not feel thick and does not clog pores.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">beautyblender is a favorite of makeup artists and Dermstore customers alike, with more than 139+ reviews. This egg-shaped sponge makes <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-use-the-beauty-blender/\">applying foundation</a> a cinch (seriously, no streaks!). Use the pointy tip to apply foundation easily around creases of your nose, mouth and eyes; use the rounded edge to blend foundation onto your forehead, cheeks and chin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe best makeup applicator out there!\u201d raves one Dermstore customer. \u201cIt does not soak up and waste product and helps to put [the] product on smooth!\u201d Another adds, \u201cI\u2019ve really love my beautyblender.

Not only is it one of the most researched skin care ingredients today, but it is also one of the most highly recommended by dermatologists everywhere.\u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know a dermatologist who doesn\u2019t use retinol or tretinoin,\u201d confirms\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/dr-heather-d-rogers/\">board-certified dermatologist, Heather Rogers</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ve all read the studies and we all use it. I used it on my face, neck, chest, arms and backs of hands most nights. It\u2019s good stuff, give it a try.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still, despite its popularity, most people don\u2019t fully understand how it works and how to use it properly. To get the skinny on this widely talked about anti-aging ingredient, we asked Dr. Rogers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinol, tretinoin, vitamin A\u2014we\u2019ve all heard these terms before, but while all three ingredients are connected in some way, those are not one and the same.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cRetinol is a weaker, over-the-counter version of tretinoin, which is a prescription vitamin A derivative,\u201d explains Dr. Rogers. \u201cIt is highly effective in reversing sun damage and signs of aging. Both retinol and prescription tretinoin have been shown to do great things for the skin, including treatment of acne, reversal of sun damage (photo-aging), improved skin smoothness and texture, improvement of skin discoloration, decreased fine lines, tightened pores and decreased inflammation associated with rosacea.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Rogers, retinol comes in multiple strengths; the most common are 1%, 0.5%, .0.3% and 0.25%. If your product doesn\u2019t specify the percentage of retinol on the label, it usually means the concentration is weaker than .25%, which may not give you the full benefits of retinol. \u201cStudies suggest you need to use at least 0.25% retinol or 0.025% tretinoin to be effective, so I recommend using a product that specifies the percentage.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing a retinol product, Dr. Rogers says it\u2019s best to start with the lowest concentration before moving up. Another thing to consider is your skin type. \u201cIf you have thick or oily skin, try a higher-strength product. If you have thin or dry skin, start with the lower-strength option,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When used correctly and consecutively, retinol has been shown to deliver results\u2014brighter, smoother skin\u2014in as little as four weeks. However, some people find retinol too harsh on their skin, so they discontinue the treatment before they even see visible results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThere is a lot of concern about retinol/tretinoin being harsh or irritating to the skin. This is a misunderstanding,\u201d\u00a0explains Dr. Rogers. \u201cThese products stimulate cell turnover, meaning that new cells push out old cells. It\u2019s a wonderful thing! However, if you use too much you will stimulate too much cell turnover, and your skin will get flaky and red.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how should you use retinol to achieve the results you\u2019re after and without irritating your skin? The trick, according to Dr. Rogers, is to use less and to start slow.\u00a0\u201cRetinol is a treatment, not a cream. You do not need to cover your entire face with it. Use a pea-size amount or less and dab a touch on your forehead, cheeks and chin and then massage in. It will feel like half of your face did not get any. Not to worry, the cells talk to each other and the message is passed along. Follow the retinol with your favorite nighttime moisturizer.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Rogers, retinol products are best used at night after washing and drying your face. If it\u2019s your first time using retinol, here\u2019s the best way to start:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin and are still worried about trying retinol, Dr. Rogers has a few more tips on how to go about using retinol:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With Dr. Rogers\u2019 advice in mind, you\u2019re now ready to pick the right retinol product for you.

While many people can have a skin reaction at some point or another to a product or ingredient, those with persistent issues are classified as having sensitive skin. When skin acts up, it\u2019s best to listen and try to find the real reason behind your symptoms. Read our articles below to get dermatologist-approved skin care tips and recommendations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With about half the population claiming to have experienced some sort of skin irritation\u2014redness, burning, itching and peeling\u2014at some point in their lives, it\u2019s no wonder most people identify their skin type as sensitive. But according to\u00a0Beth Bialko, Associate Director of Global Curriculum at the International Dermal Institute, far fewer people actually do have this skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While treatments for sensitive, rosacea-prone skin are seldom permanent, the good news is that there are things you can do to alleviate its symptoms. Here, Dr. Magovern shares some tips on how to address redness and take care of your skin if you have this condition.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin\u2014easily irritated by chemicals and fragrances, or prone to redness, rashes and irritation\u2014it\u2019s essential to steer clear of harsh ingredients and opt for both gentle products and methods.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those with sensitive skin, finding the right moisturizer that won\u2019t leave your face red or itchy is a battle all its own. Who wants their skin to suffer the consequences of endless amounts of trial and error? Luckily, there are now a variety of moisturizers formulated for those specifically with sensitive skin, with benefits that go beyond hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Face oil is one of those products you\u2019ve heard about but likely have been too intimidated to try\u2014especially if you have sensitive skin.

But what many of us may not realize is that although they are often used interchangeably, moisturizing and hydration are not exactly the same thing. While both are key in providing skin with much-needed nourishment, knowing the difference will help you make the best choice when targeting your skin\u2019s specific needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisturizers and hydrators both address the importance of making sure the skin is getting all the water it needs to fight dryness and dehydration, premature signs of aging and environmental damage. The difference, however, lies mostly in how they go about achieving these results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHydration [refers to] the water content <em>within </em>the cells that leads them to swell and be plump and bouncy, thus reflecting light well. If water flows out of the cells and the cells are dehydrated, they can become shriveled, which leads to lackluster skin,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.bellaskininstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Guanche, MD, FAAD</a>. This means that when you\u2019re using a topical hydrator, you\u2019re infusing your cells with water and improving your skin\u2019s ability to absorb moisture and nutrients.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, moisturizing is about trapping and sealing in moisture to build the skin\u2019s protective barrier, prevent water loss and keep the skin soft and smooth, says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/stayskinsafe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, FAAD</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your skin tends to be on the dry side, it\u2019s easy to assume that a healthy dose of moisturizer is all it takes to restore its plump appearance and youthful glow. While this may be true at times, it\u2019s also possible that your skin may not, in fact, be dry but dehydrated. And if the latter is true, then a hydrator is what you need to get the job done.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To know if your skin is dry or dehydrated, it\u2019s important to take note of your skin\u2019s condition. The skin has a natural lipid barrier that protects itself from damage and water loss. If you\u2019re prone to having dry, flaky skin, it\u2019s a tell-tale sign that it\u2019s not producing enough lipid cells to form a protective barrier, making it unable to lock in moisture. And that\u2019s where moisturizers come in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cA moisturizer\u2019s job is to reduce the amount of water that evaporates off of the skin to minimize transepidermal water loss. They lock in and seal in moisture,\u201d explains Dr. Guanche. Moisturizing is particularly helpful for skin that is dry and peeling or flaking after undergoing a chemical peel, using Retin A or during the winter, Dr. Guanche adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Meanwhile, if you\u2019re dealing with a dull and lackluster complexion with fine lines and wrinkles becoming more noticeable, your skin may be battling dehydration. \u201cDehydrated skin means the cells are parched and starved of water. When this happens, they are not plump and volumized and appear shriveled collectively,\u201d explains Dr. Guanche. \u201cPeople can have hydrated but dry skin or dehydrated but moisturized skin. Ideally, we want hydrated, bouncy, swollen cells that have topical moisture locked into them,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Drinking plenty of water is still the easiest way to hydrate your skin, but those with dehydrated skin may want to supplement with a topical hydrator that binds and draws water into the cells, suggests Dr. Guanche. Natural humectants allow the skin to improve its ability to hydrate itself over time, so look out for products that contain <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">aloe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-benefits-honey/\">honey</a>, alpha hydroxy acids and marine extracts. Synthetic humectants, glycerin, urea and propylene glycol are some of the ingredients you want to keep an eye out for.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHydrating ingredients are generally appropriate for all skin types. They are water-soluble, won\u2019t clog pores and should be devoid of alcohols so they don\u2019t actively dry out or irritate the skin surface,\u201d adds Dr. Shainhouse.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for moisturizers, there is a wide variety of options in terms of formula and ingredients. \u201cMoisturizers can be lighter or heavier and formulated for different seasons and different skin types,\u201d says Dr. Shainhouse. \u201cWarm, sweaty spring and summer months may call for a lightweight gel or light lotion, while dry, cold and windy fall/winter weather may require heavier products with ceramides, oils (<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">coconut</a>, almond), butters (shea or cocoa) or dimethicone,\u201d she notes. These ingredients are known not only for their moisturizing and nourishing effects but also for their ability to counter the signs of aging and free radical damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To choose which type of moisturizer is best for your skin type, Dr. Guanche says, \u201cFor acne-prone skin, a light, oil-free moisturizer works best, usually in the form of a lotion. These have less oil and more water content. For combination skin, a lotion or cream will do fine, while a serum or a more emollient cream is best for dry skin types.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For best results, hydrators and moisturizers <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/in-what-order-do-i-apply-my-skin-care-products-infographic/\">should be applied</a> morning (before sunscreen) and night. \u201cYou can apply moisturizing lotions or creams after applying your hydrator so it doesn\u2019t peel,\u201d Dr. Guanche adds.</p>"},

Mushrooms also hydrate skin, but to get that effect you\u2019ll have to apply them topically, says Dr. Grossman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Passler breaks mushrooms down into two groups: healthy and therapeutic. \u201cThe healthy mushrooms like white button, cremini, portobello and oyster are good sources of minerals, B vitamins, protein and phytonutrients for general health maintenance,\u201d he says. \u201cThe therapeutic mushrooms are more potent sources of these same ingredients and have been shown to help treat a wide variety of diseases from cancer to diabetes,\u201d Passler adds. (Reishi and chaga are examples of therapeutic mushrooms.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a deeper dive, here\u2019s a look at the health and skin benefits of some of the most popular mushrooms:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Finnish Chaga:</strong> \u201cThis Russian and Northern European mushroom is rich in minerals and acts as a potent antiviral and antibacterial agent to fight a wide variety of infections,\u201d says Passler. A study published in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22135889\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms</a> found that chaga may aid in cancer treatment as it helped decrease the instances of tumors spreading. Chaga has antioxidant properties which means it can also help protect skin against oxidative stress that can lead to signs of aging like wrinkles. A study published in the journal <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4145793/pdf/ECAM2014-259836.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</a> found that nonotus obliquus<strong>\u00a0</strong>(chaga mushroom) extract curbs melanin production, meaning it may help with skin lightening.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shiitake:</strong> This type of mushroom \u201chas long been used by herbalists to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels and numerous studies have shown them to be helpful in slowing the progression of certain cancers,\u201d says Pessler. A study published in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25866155\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journal of the American College of Nutrition</a> found that consuming shiitake mushrooms daily could help improve your immune system. As for skin care, kojic acid, a well-known skin lightener, is found in shiitake mushrooms, says Dr. Grossman. \u201cShiitake mushrooms, in addition to having kojic acid, also contain antioxidants and selenium that can decrease irritation and calm inflammation,\u201d adds Dr. Grossman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Reishi:</strong> This bitter mushroom has potent anti-bacterial and anti-viral effects, explains Pessler. \u201cIt can be a helpful complement to your cold and flu therapies,\u201d he says. \u201cSome doctors even tout it as an essential component to an effective anti-aging regime.\u201d The <a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/reishi-mushroom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a> notes that reishi mushrooms contain beta-glucans, complex sugars, and that lab studies say that these compounds may be able to help stop the spread and growth of cancer cells. They also note that there are some stall studies that suggest that reishi mushrooms can strengthen your immune system but that more research needs to be conducted before this type of mushroom can be used alongside cancer treatments. As for skin care, Dr. Grossman says that reishi mushrooms are good hydrators in addition to being high in antioxidants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>White: </strong>White mushrooms are chock-full of good-for-you nutrients like B vitamins and protein for general skin and health boost, says Passler. According to research from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/07/100729101609.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Agricultural Research Services</a>, white button mushrooms (the most common type of mushroom in the U.S.), may help boost immunity because they increase production of antiviral and other proteins that are released by your cells when they\u2019re trying to protect and repair tissues in your body.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSince these mushrooms contain a wide variety of therapeutic substances (sterols, glycosides, enzymes, polysaccharides and minerals), low doses can be taken for mild health concerns like the cold or flu and higher doses may be needed for treating more chronic health concerns,\u201d explains Passler. Lower doses can be attained in as little as one serving of mushrooms daily, says Passler. For higher doses, you may want to consider taking therapeutic mushroom supplements that will give you what you need in three to eight capsules a day, he adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Passler says he would put therapeutic mushrooms in the same category as medicinal herbs. They can be helpful when recommended by a health care provider who\u2019s familiar with mushrooms, but there are a few circumstances in which you\u2019d want to be careful: if you\u2019re pregnant or breastfeeding, if you have low blood pressure, if you have blood-clotting disorders, if you have certain autoimmune disorders, or if you have surgery coming up. Always consult a medical professional before adding any new supplements to your routine or making any major dietary change.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For skin care, keep this in mind: \u201cMost of the science behind ingredients like reishi relates to the benefits for internal use,\u201d notes Close. \u201cBe careful that brands aren\u2019t conflating the benefits of supplements\u2014which can have an impact on skin health\u2014with the benefits for topical use,\u201d she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to take advantage of all the skin care benefits mushrooms have to offer? Try these products formulated with mushroom, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For many of us, acne often isn\u2019t left behind when our teen years are over.

That being said, some cleansers (especially ones for oily and acne-prone complexions) strip away essential moisture, leaving your face feeling tight and dry. This cleanser, made specifically for oily, combination and acne-prone skin, is made with mushroom extract, which acts as a gentle astringent to make pores look smaller and control oil and betaine, a compound found in beets that keeps water in to prevent dehydration.</p>"},

While we understand that it can be hard to give up the products you have grown to love over the years, there comes a time when you need to shake up your daily regimen to address your skin\u2019s changing needs. And now that we have officially welcomed another year, it\u2019s the best time to take stock of what works (and what doesn\u2019t) for your skin and find out if your regimen is due for a well-deserved fresh start.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the thought of parting with your go-to moisturizer may be enough to give you nightmares, it\u2019s important to understand that some of your favorite products may no longer be giving your skin the nourishment it needs. Especially when you consider how your skin is affected by the natural aging process and by changes in your habits and lifestyle.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe different stages in a person\u2019s life will determine what products should be used. Teens will more likely use acne products to fight breakouts. For <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-in-your-30s/\">those in their 30s</a>, the focus should shift to aging prevention,\u201d says educator and licensed esthetician <a href=\"http://www.kimeeraspa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Annastazia Unce</a>. \u201cMajor <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-brands-for-babies/\">life events like pregnancy</a> and menopause can affect hormones and send skin into a whirlwind of changes. Dryness, hyperpigmentation and hormonal breakouts concentrated in the jawline will become more frequent,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medical esthetician <a href=\"http://www.restoresdplasticsurgery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erin Murphy</a> echoes this, adding that the amount of humidity in the air, changes in your diet and the stress hormone cortisol \u201care things that can cause your beloved skin care products to not work as well as they once did.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your skin concerns can be linked to a number of factors, but sometimes, adding or switching out a product or two is all it takes to keep your skin in fighting form. Below, we list down some of the most common signs your skin is a prime candidate for a much-needed transition.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve recently started a topical treatment and your skin actually gets worse, you\u2019ll want to take note of the active ingredient in your product. \u201cIf skin is irritated after a new topical treatment, I first examine the treatment. A topical vitamin-A product commonly produces some redness/irritation as part of its process\u2014and this does not indicate an allergy or problem,\u201d explains facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon <a href=\"http://www.artisanplasticsurgery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inessa Fishman, MD</a>. But if your skin is truly irritated, Dr. Fishman recommends using the product every second or third night instead and switching to a gentle cleanser and moisturizer to ease dryness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To soothe irritation, licensed esthetician <a href=\"http://www.pattybellmakeup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Patty Bell</a> says, \u201cYou cannot go wrong with natural products like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">aloe vera</a> to heal burning skin, organic <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-benefits-honey/\">honey</a> to help fight infection and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">coconut</a> or almond oil to nourish and hydrate skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cDry skin can be genetic, a by-product of excessive cleansing and oil-stripping, dry environment and incorrect diet, among other factors,\u201d explains Dr. Fishman. To prevent excessive dryness, she suggests replacing your alcohol- and acid-based products with ones that contain moisturizing ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a> and ceramides, particularly in the drier winter months.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over-exfoliation is also another major contributor to dry skin, says Unce, adding that, \u201cStripping the skin\u2019s natural \u2018acid mantle\u2019 leads to sensitivity, dryness and dark spots.\u201d If your complexion is becoming noticeably drier, she suggests refraining from using salt, sugar and other harsh scrubs that can strip skin of its natural moisture and cause micro-scarring. Instead, switch to exfoliating polishes with finer granules that are gentler on the skin and reach for hydrating toners and moisturizers with water as one of the first ingredients.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While having dry or oily skin is determined by genetics, using the wrong products can over-dry your skin and interfere with your skin\u2019s sebum production, causing it to produce more oil than necessary. \u201cIf you spend every day trying to remove every ounce of oil off your skin, it will actually try to produce more. The key is to keep oil production in check and to not over-treat your skin,\u201d explains Murphy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Salicylic acid and clay are two of the best ingredients to look for if you\u2019re dealing with excess grease as these can absorb oil without being too harsh on your skin, says Unce. To prevent drying out your skin, swap out your alcohol-based toner for hydrating floral water and opt for gentle cleansers (instead of bar soaps) with natural pH-balancing ingredients like honey, apple cider vinegar and nourishing oils like jojoba, olive and argan oils.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Murphy, up to 80 percent of visible skin aging is caused by sun damage, making UVA and UVB rays the top culprits when dealing with hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone and texture along with wrinkles. Switch to a broad spectrum formula that defends skin from both types of rays, or increase the SPF (at least an SPF 35 for everyday use, says Murphy) if the product you\u2019re using now already protects against both.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But it doesn\u2019t end there. Those \u201cfreckles\u201d and dark spots that seem to sprout out of nowhere can also be the result of post-acne scarring, hormones (from pregnancy) and over-exfoliation, says Unce. And while <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-hydroquinone-and-is-it-safe/\">hydroquinone</a> is the quickest and most effective way to brighten discoloration, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-skin-lighteners/\">natural ingredients</a> like vitamin C, arbutin (that prevents the formation of melanin) and gentle exfoliators like kojic, azelaic and mandelic acids are also \u201cvery effective in lightening dark spots and are great alternatives to hydroquinone,\u201d adds Unce.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While a natural rosy flush is a sure indicator of healthy skin, redness (and other signs of inflammation) usually means \u201cthe skin is protecting itself,\u201d explains Unce. \u201cSome people that are genetically predisposed to having sensitive skin experience redness from merely washing their face. On the other hand, sensitivity can also be a sign of over-exfoliation, which impairs the skin barrier and makes it highly reactive,\u201d she adds. In the case of the latter, Unce suggests focusing on hydrating and repairing your skin, which can be achieved by \u201cusing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, oats, cucumber, aloe vera, sea algae and lipid oils.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, skin that suddenly turns an <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/products-for-rosacea/\">angry shade of red</a> is \u201coften an indication that something in your product\u2019s ingredient list may be too harsh for your skin,\u201d says licensed esthetician Nancy Reagan, founder of <a href=\"https://bellareinaspa.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bella Reina Spa</a>. Sulfates and benzoyl peroxide are common offenders, so make sure to switch to one that is free of both.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hives (which can be caused by stress), sensitivities from food or skin care products and sunburn, windburn or frostbite can all result in skin that suddenly stings and itches, says Dr. Fishman, so it\u2019s best to keep track of new foods you\u2019ve introduced to your diet and do a patch test of your moisturizers or serums before deciding to make them staples in your AM or PM routines. It\u2019s especially important to check your skin care products for potential allergens or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/ingredients-to-avoid-in-skin-care/\">ingredients that could react to the sun</a> or a medication you\u2019re taking, adds Murphy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another major reason your skin itches, stings and appears blotchy? Over-exfoliation. \u201cOver-exfoliating and using retinoids or heavy acids will almost always cause some discomfort, but if you take a couple of days off and use a gentle moisturizer for a couple of days, your skin will restore itself,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cIf you\u2019re new to exfoliating with a scrub or mask, it\u2019s best to start off with twice a week and see how your skin tolerates it,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Small, raised bumps on the surface of your skin may be due to a histamine reaction, especially when they\u2019re accompanied by redness and itching, says Unce. To soothe your skin, apply calming ingredients such as aloe or honey and switch to gentler products that don\u2019t contain known skin irritants like synthetic fragrances, parabens, phthalates and sulfates.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A skin condition called <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-are-milia/\">milia</a> can also result in hard, white bumps, which are mostly concentrated around the eyes or forehead but can also be found anywhere on the face. \u201cThey develop when skin flakes or oil become trapped in little pockets near the surface of the skin. They are common around the eyes and forehead as eye cream tends to be a little heavier and can clog the skin if not applied lightly,\u201d explains Murphy. Switching to more lightweight products may prevent the condition from worsening, says Murphy, adding that, \u201cMilia can be extracted, but it\u2019s best done by a professional to be sure it\u2019s done in a clean environment with no chance of infection.\u201d</p>"},

Think wrinkles, fine lines and sagging and crepey skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In your 20s or 30s, keeping wrinkles and fine lines at bay isn\u2019t usually high up on your list of priorities. After all, a dot of eye cream here and a dab of serum there are all it normally takes for your skin to bounce back after a night of partying. However, the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/normal-aging-process/\">normal aging process</a> affects your skin in a variety of ways and its effects begin to develop even before your midlife crisis rears its head.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAs part of the natural aging process, our body produces less and less of the key elements that keep us looking younger. Collagen protein provides firmness and support. Yet, by the time a woman reaches menopause, she has about 45 percent less collagen,\u201d explains beauty chemist and skin care expert <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Pollock</a>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">Hyaluronic acid</a> binds 1000 times its weight in moisture, hydrating the skin. However, by the time we are 50, we have about half the amount of hyaluronic acid we had when we were younger.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of you may have started your skin care routines in your teens, but you might be guilty of overlooking your neck and chest. Turns out, there\u2019s a reason we often hear that a woman\u2019s age is seen in her neck. According to board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.moderndermct.com/biography-rhonda-quain-klein/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rhonda Klein, MD, MPH, FAAD</a>, the neck should be treated the same way you take care of your face as it often shows age even before you sprout your first crow\u2019s feet or laugh line.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe skin on our neck is actually thinner, making the loss of collagen and elastin more noticeable and quicker. Gravity is also against us with our neck, often creating \u2018turkey neck\u2019 if we\u2019re not careful. With fewer oil glands, the neck is also less plump and hydrated than our face,\u201d explains Dr. Klein.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from the natural aging process, genetics and other external stressors also contribute to sagging skin and necklines. Sun exposure and smoking, for example, can cause wrinkles, pigmentation and disease. Other factors include:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u2019s easy to assume that the same products you use on your face will also work for your d\u00e9colletage, achieving a younger-looking neck and chest often requires a more targeted approach. \u201cThe most important daily protection for the neck is sunscreen\u2014SPF 30+, ideally. After this, using hydrating and tightening products can be beneficial to prevent signs of aging,\u201d adds Dr. Klein.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reach for specially formulated neck-firming products that contain alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and hyaluronic acid to exfoliate and hydrate skin as well as antioxidants like vitamins A, C and E. Pollock also recommends peptides to \u201cpromote the synthesis of collagen and help firm up the skin\u201d and retinol to \u201clessen fine lines and deep wrinkles.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your neck doesn\u2019t have to betray your age!

Aside from being a potent antioxidant, countless studies back its ability to stimulate cell regeneration, rebuild collagen, reduce fine lines and wrinkles and fade age spots. It also exfoliates the skin to refine the texture, minimize pore size and even skin tone.\u00a0\u201cIt has the best science behind it,\u201d says Dr. Ashley Magovern. \u201cThere are countless studies that show over and over again that retinoic acid derivatives, like retinol, really do what everyone says they do.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the market for a new retinol product? Chances are you\u2019ve seen the number of retinol options available in the beauty aisle today\u2014all of them promising that younger-looking complexion we all crave. But not all retinol products are created equal. Strength, purity of the ingredients, stability of the formula, the method of delivery and even the packaging of the product\u2014all of these factors play an important role when choosing your product. Another crucial thing to consider is your skin\u2019s own ability to tolerate this potent ingredient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help us dive deeper into the subject, we tapped the experts at <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinCeuticals_100113.htm\">SkinCeuticals</a>, one of the leading professional skin care brands that utilize this ingredient in its products. Here they talked about what makes SkinCeuticals\u2019 retinol lineup unique, how to choose which one to use and how to use it for best results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThere are many formulas that contain the ingredient retinol. Retinol is an ingredient that is both light and air sensitive. Retinol exposed to air and light potentially risk a reduction of formula effectiveness when topically applied. The best retinol products contain ingredients that support retinol\u2019s stability and [are] encapsulated in a way that doesn\u2019t expose active ingredients to air or light to maintain its efficacy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+03_78144.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+05+Refining+Night+Cream_4506.htm\">SkinCeuticals 0.5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+10+Maximum+Strength+Refining+Night+Cream_4505.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol 1.0</a> all contain pure retinol (versus retinol formulated with a derivative of soybean) that is encapsulated to ensure maximum stability and provide slow release on skin for improved tolerability.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe numbers in your retinol\u2019s product label are indicators of the strength of the formula. SkinCeuticals\u2019 retinol line is available in three different strengths: Retinol .3, Retinol.5 and Retinol 1.0. How you choose the strength depends on your skin\u2019s ability to tolerate retinol, how long you\u2019ve been using retinol and the results you\u2019re after. Here\u2019s a quick guide:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cConsistent nightly usage of retinol has demonstrated anti-aging benefits, including brightening, improvement of elasticity and dermal thickening.\u00a0The goal is to work your way up to nightly usage. If it\u2019s your first time using a retinol, start by integrating retinol into your nightly regimen two to three times a week in the first two weeks. Make sure that retinol is the first product applied to freshly cleansed skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With consistent usage, you should start seeing results\u2014overall improvement in the youthful of appearance skin, improved skin elasticity, decrease in fine lines and wrinkles\u2014after 12 weeks. If you want to track your results, we suggest taking skin photos before usage of retinol, and then at two-week increments after using retinol.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cVisible side effects of retinol usage during the first couple of weeks include the appearance of peeling, excessively dry skin, light irritation, itching and the sensation of skin warmth. These are fairly common and sometimes to be expected. However, if you feel excessive burning, excessive stinging, skin swelling and skin inflammation, or erythema, irritation, burning and itching that lasts longer than three days, contact a medical professional for a skin evaluation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One misconception we often hear is that using retinol \u201cthins the skin.\u201d It\u2019s actually the opposite: one of the long-term benefits of retinol usage is encouraging skin appearance to be thicker and more youthful.\u201d</p>"},

Or feeling like our skin is so out of control, we can\u2019t fix it. Red blotches or any type of influx in hormones or bacteria can spur inflammation\u2014a blanket term that defines our body\u2019s reaction to something. Or as dermatologist and clinical faculty <u><a href=\"http://www.doctorrogers.com\">Heather D. Rogers, MD</a></u> explains, it\u2019s how our immune system fights against a perceived threat, to protect from further injury. While it can be cumbersome and frustrating, inflammation lets us know something is wrong and challenges us to utilize the best methods and products to alleviate our symptoms and get our pores back to their healthiest state. Here is what you need to know about inflammation, along with recommended products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though some people occasionally experience inflamed skin or other symptoms (more on this later), there are others who experience this more frequently. As Dr. Rogers explains, the first type of inflammation, aka acute inflammation, is our body\u2019s immediate response to an injury. This type could happen to almost anyone and usually has a rapid onset that lasts a few days before passing. If you experience the symptoms more frequently, what you have could be chronic inflammation, in which the culprit is usually viral infections, autoimmune disease, a foreign body, gluten sensitivity or a slew of other factors. If you\u2019re worried, it\u2019s best to talk to your trusted physician or dermatologist for a clearer diagnosis or treatment plan.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Board-certified dermatologist <u><a href=\"https://www.skincareandlaser.com/about-jeanette-black.php\">Jeanette M. Black, M.D.</a></u> explains that redness, swelling, overheating and pain are all symptoms of an inflammation. And for some, acne spots or breakouts could pop up, too. \u201cWhen our bodies are exposed to infections, the inflammatory pathway results in symptoms such as fevers, fatigue and drainage. When the skin is subjected to trauma from injuries or UV radiation, the inflammatory cascade can result in redness, pigmentation, scar formation and dysregulation of collagen and elastin fibers,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Black also explains that our skin will react to inflammation with an increase in blood flow to the skin, making our faces red, sometimes causing swelling, pain or itchiness. \u201cThe dilated blood vessels also make it easier for your body to absorb the chemicals you are putting on your face, increasing the risk of further irritation. This is why it is so important to be incredibly selective about what you are putting on inflamed skin,\u201d she explains. And of course, she adds, be mindful of your diet.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Rogers shares that because our gut and our skin are the two largest organs in our body and have exposure to possible irritants that could lead to inflammation, our digestion directly impacts the condition of our pores. Once the inflammatory pathway is activated, our immune system is turned on everywhere! \u201cWhat this means is, if your gut is inflamed, your immune system is revved up, making skin more sensitive, more likely to become inflamed. The opposite is also true; if your gut is calm and your immune system is quiet, your skin will be less sensitive,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who battle inflammation, an anti-inflammatory diet is suggested, since it avoids foods that commonly irritate the gut to prevent activation of the immune system and inflammatory pathways. \u201cThere are some standard foods to avoid but also, everyone is different and what inflames one person may not do the same for another,\u201d she shares.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What types of food will work against inflammation? For starters, Dr. Black suggests stocking your daily meals with picks high in vitamins and minerals, like fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and whole grains, fatty fish and oils. You\u2019d also want to avoid anything processed, as well as any food that\u2019s high in sugar, gluten, diary and other inflammatory ingredients.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to go the topical route with skin care products or add a supplement to your diet, there are many effective ways to reap their benefits. Dr. Black says that since we can\u2019t all eat 100 percent clean all the time, anti-inflammatory skin care products and supplements can be beneficial and helpful, too. \u201cSupplements with vitamins and minerals can be beneficial for those [who] find it difficult to keep up a diet rich in all food groups including vegetables and fruits. Topical cosmeceuticals with various ingredients have also been formulated to help fortify the benefits of a healthy diet and lifestyle,\u201d she raves.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are a few ingredients to look for in your skin care products and supplements:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Topical: <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Ginger+Clarifying+Concentrate_75108.htm\">Naturopathica Ginger Clarifying Concentrate</a></u></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve been skipping out on a daily face serum, think again.

Just add up to 40 drops to water, juice or tea to reap the benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone\u2019s obsessed with CBD and manuka honey but what happens when you combine them? Magic. In addition to CBD, this balm is loaded with vitamin E, shea butter, rosehip oil, orange peel butter and grapeseed oil to give your skin overdue TLC. Once massaged into your skin, this solid skin balm transforms into a creamy consistency that helps replenish dry, cracked skin while reducing redness and swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It Works</strong>: Omegas 3 and 6 are essential fatty acids, which not only help restore moisture to dry skin but also reduce inflammation and redness.\u00a0\u201cOmega 3 and 6 fatty acids are an important part of a healthy diet and are known to have anti-inflammatory benefits, particularly with regards to heart disease and diabetes,\u201d Dr. Black shares.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Is your skin feeling lifeless and dull? Consider a vitamin-packed hydrating oil like this one from Lancer Skincare. This unique blend of grape seed, jojoba and olive oil lends your skin a dewy glow without that heavy or greasy feel on the skin. Beyond your face, this oil can be used to nourish your nails, hands and body.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Treat your skin from the inside out with these dietary supplements made with a combination of omega-3, omega- 6 and vitamin A. When combined, these nutrients fight off toxins, repair dehydrated skin and reverse the effects of aging. Take one supplement twice a day for clearer, more hydrated skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It Works</strong>: Bruise easily? This is your best bet. \u201cVitamin K oxide is an iron-chelating agent which makes it useful in regulating bleeding and bruising. Vitamin K is a vital part of a healthy diet, but it is also important to remember that adverse reactions can occur with overdosing this vitamin,\u201d Dr. Black explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t just blame your sleep patterns: Those pesky dark circles are all thanks to your body\u2019s blood flow. The unwanted under-eye circles pop up as we age when the skin below our eyes gets thinner and our blood vessels become more prominent. Serums with vitamin K, including this one by Sanitas Skincare, help alleviate redness and puffiness all over the face when applied daily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Why choose one when you can have them all? Give your heart and bones a little extra love with this daily supplement boosted with vitamin K, calcium, folate and turmeric rhizome extract. Even better, it\u2019s given an extra oomph with blueberry, parsley and kale.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Redness is probably one of the most obvious signs of skin inflammation, and for those who constantly struggle with it, this soothing face mask can help. Aside from arnica, which aids with inflammation, this mask also features antioxidants, moisturizers and conditioning botanicals to help repair damage and shield skin from environmental triggers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trusted by professional athletes and cosmetic surgeons, arnica is known for its widespread healing and anti-inflammatory properties, whether you\u2019re recovering from a mean game of volleyball or recovering from surgery. If you\u2019re looking for a more natural approach to relieve your aches and pains, this homeopathic supplement is for you.</p>"},

Unfortunately, many of us who struggle with acne will be left with the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Remove-Acne-Marks-on-the-Face_1987.htm\">lasting effect of scarring</a> for years.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thanks to the advancement of technology, there are now so many <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Fade-Acne-Scars-Using-Creams-and-Serums_1967.htm\">different products like topical serums</a>, oils and moisturizers that promise to reduce, if not totally eliminate, the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Tips-to-Prevent-Facial-Scarring_1936.htm\">appearance of acne scars</a>. But the problem with these products is that it takes time\u2014and patience\u2014to see results. Often, they do not help with the texture. What\u2019s more, if you don\u2019t exfoliate regularly, these products could have a hard time getting absorbed into the skin and doing their job. This is why microdermabrasion is one of the most recommended ways to treat acne scars.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Microdermabrasion uses a combination of diamond-granule exfoliation and suction to remove the top couple of layers of dead and nearly dead skin cells. In effect, it peels off age from your skin. But what does this mean to you and your acne scars? The top layer of your skin, the stratum corneum, is already dead. The second layer is maturing. These layers are where all of those imperfections in our skin are amplified. Aside from sloughing off the skin and scar tissue, microdermabrasion creates an ideal surface for topical scar treatments to be fully absorbed into the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Acne scars are typically very receptive to microdermabrasion. Every time you go through microdermabrasion, you are getting deeper into those layers of skin and therefore accelerating cell turnover, creating newer, younger, smoother, more-perfect skin. This type of facial is also perfect for those who are too busy for the downtime that other options dictate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Professional in-office microdermabrasion treatments cost an average of $100 to $150 per session. For more severe acne scars, it is recommended to return for several treatments, spaced once every week or two, to see visible results.<strong><br>\n</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Microdermabrasion_500137.htm\">at-home microdermabrasion devices</a>, you can now enjoy the benefits of microdermabrasion without visiting your dermatologist or aesthetician. You may wonder how something as powerful as professional microdermabrasion can be done safely by you.\u00a0These at-home microdermabrasion systems, like the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Microderm+MD+Diamond+Peeling_28288.htm\">MicrodermMD</a> or <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_RejuvadermMD+Handheld+Microdermabrasion+System_58694.htm\">RejuvadermMD</a>, use the same procedure of exfoliation and suction as the professional kind, but at a less aggressive level that even beginners can manage. These are the two best reasons why you\u00a0<em>should\u00a0</em>try this at home:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because home treatment machines are designed to be safer and easier to operate, they can generally be used more frequently than the professional machines. Frequent treatments allow you to renew your skin\u2019s surface more often and really attack those scars. Personally, I do microderm treatments two to three times per week year-round. And remember, you can also perform <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/microdermabrasion-for-the-body/\">microdermabrasion on your body</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>READERS\u2014If you would like to speak with me more about acne scarring and/or how home microdermabrasion can enhance your personal skin care regimen, I invite you to reach out to me in the comments section below.\u00a0I would love to hear from you!</strong></p>"},

In reality, everyone\u2019s facial skin is sensitive to oil buildup,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/air-pollution-effects-inflammaging/\">pollutants</a>, stressors and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/anti-aging-for-sensitive-skin/\">sun exposure</a>, which makes maintaining flawless skin a tall order. If you\u2019re not sure what type of skin problem you have, here are some telltale signs to spot the difference between a breakout and more serious skin issues like rosacea, eczema, hives and allergic reactions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From your temperamental teens to well into adulthood, acne is the pesky sidekick that can rear its ugly head at a moment\u2019s notice. Date nights and big business meetings seem to beckon them to appear on cue. Unfortunately, acne can form swiftly when oil and dead skin get trapped in the pores, causing inflammation in a variety of guises. But how do you differentiate a breakout from other types of irritation? Whiteheads produce those little heads at the tip, while blackheads form when trapped oil darkens, leaving behind a forest of tiny, black spots those devious pore-cleansing strips are supposed to remove. On the more severe end of the acne scale, small and sore red bumps, called papules or pustules, tend to be deeper and have more inflammation (i.e. redness) than whiteheads or blackheads. And cystic acne forms when papules or pustules become even larger under the skin, developing into lesions called nodules. Severe acne\u2019s other dreaded side effect is discoloration and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Scars_25_0.htm\">scarring</a>\u00a0that can take years to fade and can even be permanent.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you suddenly start applying concealer with a heavy hand around the nose and cheeks to cover up that weeklong blush, it\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Rosacea_27_0.htm\">might mean you have rosacea</a>. While teens and 20-somethings lament acne, rosacea doesn\u2019t normally appear until after 30 and is a lot more common in women. Telltale signs of this skin condition include sudden flushing, large red or inflamed patches, increased redness around the nose and cheeks and visible blood vessels. If it goes untreated, some people develop blemish-like bumps. Since it doesn\u2019t occur because of clogged pores, acne treatments may only worsen the irritation, so it\u2019s important to treat the real underlying skin issue to keep rosacea under control. Red wine, hot drinks and spicy foods may also aggravate rosacea.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daily moisturizers and night creams keep scaly, dehydrated skin cells at bay and produce that coveted, healthy glow. However, psoriasis and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Eczema_24_0.htm\">eczema</a>\u00a0don\u2019t retreat so easily as dry skin.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/difference-psoriasis-and-eczema/\">Psoriasis is a skin condition</a>\u00a0that causes persistent red, scaly, itchy patches because of the over-production of skin cells. These patches can appear anywhere on the body but are most common on the scalp, elbows, knees and lower back. Eczema also produces itchy red patches, but unlike acne, you don\u2019t have to worry about whiteheads, blackheads or papules making an appearance, but you will want to consult a doctor for treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re experiencing a rash or hives on a regular basis, try to narrow down what products you use or come in contact with, to identify what\u2019s causing the reaction. When skin meets with an irritant or allergen, it forms a dry, red, non-itchy rash known as contact dermatitis. The rash develops immediately after contact with the irritant and heals in a few days once the contact has stopped.</p>"},

Both can result from dryness, making it easy to assume that the dryness of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eczema_400027.htm?keyword=eczema\">eczema</a>\u00a0led to wrinkling, but that\u2019s not the case. Eczema only emphasizes wrinkles, and while it may be tempting to pile on your richest moisturizer to banish both, a more individual approach is necessary.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Eczema_24_0.htm\">Eczema</a>\u00a0is a skin condition that makes itself known through the presence of irritating rashes. They can appear anywhere on the body and are typically red, dry, raised and can break open upon scratching or contact. The condition could be hereditary or appear after an allergic reaction to an environmental stimulant or allergen within the immune system. Eczema is triggered for some sufferers by changes in temperature, hormone levels and even stress. Many deal with eczema from birth, while others could find themselves facing a sudden breakout after a summer heat wave.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If waking up to a face full of deep-set\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aging+Skin_300045.htm?keyword=aging%20skin\">wrinkles</a>\u00a0has you dodging the mirror in the morning, you can take a deep breath. The amount of intrinsic wrinkles that your body is set to develop is genetic, but wrinkles caused by premature aging can be prevented and slowed down so that your intrinsic wrinkles make less of an impact. Sun damage is the primary cause of wrinkles, so smooth on a lotion with SPF 30 or higher every day to all exposed skin. To streamline your routine, reach for a moisturizer that contains SPF with both UVA and UVB protection. Activities like smoking and drinking dehydrate the skin and damage it over time. Avoid tugging at or using abrasive products on your skin. Try adding an oil-based cleanser to your routine\u2014it will remove even tough makeup without drying out or scratching the surface of your skin like harsh scrubs and gels.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While eczema does not cause wrinkles, it can emphasize lines that are already there. The dry, often flaky texture of eczema makes even minor lines from dehydration appear deep and draws the eye to the area. The presence of eczema makes skin sensitive, meaning that any retinoids or glycolic acids previously used in your anti-aging routine should be avoided where you have eczema. This may result in the areas of your skin that are not affected by eczema appearing brighter and smoother than the inflamed patches.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Treating eczema takes the spotlight off of any wrinkles underneath the affected area. The products and regimen you choose should be based on the form of eczema that you are affected with. While eczema cannot be diagnosed with a test, your physician can discuss possible causes and treatment based on your lifestyle and family history. Changes to your daily routine can minimize the symptoms of eczema. Take warm showers using a gentle body wash and avoid rapid changes in temperature. Gently pat your skin dry and always avoid rubbing or scratching it. Apply a doctor-recommended or other moisturizer within three minutes of showering or washing the affected area to lock in moisture. Plug in a humidifier during the cold and dry months to keep the air in your house from drying your skin out and triggering a breakout.</p>"},

Despite endless creams, serums and peels promising a pore-free complexion, your large-pored existence is something you\u2019re usually born with. However, if your\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Large+Pores_500321.htm?keyword=large%20pores\">enlarged pores</a>\u00a0stem from clogging due to aging, sun damage, dirt and oil buildup, there are things you can do to help minimize their appearance and take a break from fussing over them in the mirror.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Throughout the day, oil, makeup, dirt and debris build up on your skin and get trapped in your pores. This buildup in your pores causes them to expand. Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Emmy Graber suggests\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Pore-Refining-Facial-Techniques_1941.htm\">regularly cleansing your skin</a>\u00a0once or twice a day to ban the buildup. If you wear makeup or sunscreen, it\u2019s most important to wash your face in the evening. Choose a gentle cleanser that\u2019s right for your skin type\u2014whether oily, dry or sensitive\u2014and use lukewarm or cold water; hot water can strip your skin of essential oils. When you\u2019re done, gently pat your skin dry\u2014don\u2019t rub\u2014to avoid irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take a good look at your current facial routine to see if your\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/cover-up-skin-concerns-with-makeup/\">makeup</a>, lotions and other facial products may be the culprit of your clogged pores. Look for products that are \u201cnon-comedogenic,\u201d which means they likely don\u2019t contain ingredients that are known to clog pores. These products are aimed at people with oily or acne-prone skin. Although the FDA does not regulate these products or provide a list of ingredients the products should not contain to be labeled non-comedogenic, it does mean that the manufacturer created the product\u2014ideally\u2014for pores that get easily clogged and irritated. However, there is no guarantee that it will not clog your pores, and every person\u2019s skin is different. If aging skin is the issue, look for a product that increases collagen production to aid skin elasticity. Retinol in prescription form or over-the-counter beauty products is highly effective.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Physical-vs.-Chemical-Exfoliation-for-Large-Pores_1914.htm\">Mechanical or chemical exfoliation</a>\u00a0products can also help remove dead skin cells and unclog pores. Mechanical exfoliation methods include brushes or rough sponges and granular scrubs. Chemical exfoliators include hydroxy acids, such as salicylic and glycolic acids; retinol; and biological enzymes, such as bromelain and papain from pineapple. The International Dermal Institute reports that salicylic acid is highly effective at reducing comedones, which are basically widened and clogged pores, such as blackheads. The institute also cautions against using very rough mechanical exfoliators such as crushed fruit pits and shells because they are too irritating. Lastly, the key is to avoid exfoliating too often, which irritates the skin; once or twice a week is sufficient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those pore strips really do work to extract dirt and debris from your pores. This can temporarily make them appear smaller, especially if they\u2019ve been clogged up with dark-colored debris.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=clay%20mask\">Clay masks</a>\u00a0also deep-clean your pores and temporarily tighten your skin to make pores appear smaller. The results are temporary, however, and you need to use these products regularly to benefit from their effects.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sun damage breaks down the collagen in your skin, which is what gives it its elasticity. This not only leads to wrinkles, but also to enlarged pores because your pores begin to sag, making them look larger. Although you can\u2019t undo damage that\u2019s already there, you can prevent further damage and maintain your pore size by protecting your skin from the sun. Apply a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sunscreen+for+Face_504183.htm\">sunscreen\u00a0</a>with at least SPF 30 at least 15 minutes before going out into the sun. Wear sunscreen even on cloudy days or in the winter; the sun\u2019s rays can still damage your skin even when it\u2019s a gray day.</p>"},

From funky face sponges to state-of-the-art cleansing brushes, there is no shortage of exfoliating solutions.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-beat-dull-skin/\">Exfoliating is an essential step</a>\u00a0in everyone\u2019s routine. Not only does it prevent breakouts by removing dead cells that build up on the surface of the skin, but it also helps to maintain a smooth complexion. While it is almost impossible to change the size of the pores, you can minimize their appearance by getting rid of the built-up dead skin cells on the skin\u2019s surface. While there are varying benefits when it comes to using physical or chemical sloughing options, it\u2019s important to consider the right one for your skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Physical exfoliation involves using various tools or abrasive substances to physically slough away the outermost layer of the skin. You can buy motorized\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Microdermabrasion_500137.htm?keyword=microdermabrasion\">dermabrasion</a>\u00a0sponges or brushes, or rough sponges and scrubs that do the same job but without the motor. Oily skin types benefit the most from \u201cmechanical\u201d exfoliators, as they can withstand more abrasive cleansing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exfoliating brushes and scrubs are widely available. They\u2019re convenient to use at home, and they provide an easy and relatively effective way to get rid of dead skin cells and impurities and temporarily minimize the appearance of large pores. They are especially effective for getting rid of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Blackheads_503595.htm?keyword=blackheads\">blackheads</a>. However, they\u2019re not always the most gentle way to exfoliate. Excessive abrasion can result in irritated skin. For those with sensitive skin, opt for gentle, fine-grained cleansers. When choosing a granular scrub, try to avoid any products with nutshells or fruit pits that can irritate skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most chemical exfoliants can be classified as two types:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Alpha+Hydroxy+Acids_300088.htm?keyword=alpha%20hydroxy%20acids\">AHA, or alpha-hydroxy acids</a>, and BHA, beta-hydroxy acids. The two most popular AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid while BHA usually refers specifically to salicylic acid. These acids help slough away dead skin cells, while potentially normalizing skin cell turnover and stimulating the growth of normal, healthy skin. Enzymatic peels, such as bromelain and papain from pineapple, help digest dead skin cells.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since chemical exfoliants do not involve rubbing the skin, they are generally safer than many physical exfoliants. Hydroxy acids, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Salicylic+Acid_500034.htm?keyword=salicylic%20acid\">salicylic</a>\u00a0and glycolic acids, have the ability to penetrate the skin for deeper exfoliation. Enzymatic exfoliators are also effective, but they are not as strong as hydroxy acids, so they\u2019re better for sensitive skin. Salicylic acid is especially effective for oily, acne-prone skin, while combination skin will benefit from an AHA that controls oil-production.</p>"},

While fatigue, stress and thinning skin are high on the list of common culprits fueling those dark circles, allergens might be yet another villain.

That\u2019s the perfect recipe for trapped blood vessels, stressed skin and a pair of sunglasses.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every spring, plants release their fragrant pollen into the air.

Also known as allergic rhinitis, many people also experience this dark circle\u2013inducing allergy around the dander of a family pet or high levels of dust.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisture develops in areas like the kitchen, bathroom and basement of your home, making the ideal environment for mold to grow. If you walk into your bathroom and start sneezing immediately, you might be dealing with this irritant. While relatively harmless in most cases, the tiny spores mold releases can cause congestion, itchy eyes, runny nose and a scratchy throat. Stuffy nasal passages may cause decreased blood flow and puffiness around the eyes. Just like hay fever, these symptoms build up over time to make the perfect dark circle cocktail.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might want to take a second look at the concealer you use to cover up dark circles, especially if you have\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_Sensitive+Skin_500009.htm?keyword=sensitive%20skin\">sensitive skin</a>. Many soaps, facial cleansers and foundations contain alcohol, glycol, talc and other additives that can leave skin cells inflamed, chapped and stressed when applied. The cells around the eyes are especially sensitive to harsh ingredients, which can lead to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Puffiness_500763.htm?keyword=puffiness\">puffiness</a>, redness and inflammation under the eyes, creating that dreaded dark circle effect. Many times this type of allergy, also known as contact dermatitis, recedes once the offending irritant is removed and the skin has a chance to heal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those dark circles could be sending you a message about your routines at the dinner table and the medicine cabinet. Many people suffer from food allergies, which means the body has an immune system reaction to a particular food, like nuts or dairy.

While there is no magic pill that will rid dark spots, age spots or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Melasma_400012.htm?keyword=melasma\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">melasma</a>\u00a0overnight, several treatments are available that will help to improve hyperpigmentation when used consistently. From prescription skin-lightening creams to over-the-counter creams, these clever ingredients can help to create a more even skin tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Skin lightening creams are the initial go-to for banishing dark patches. While they\u2019re not a quick fix, they can lighten dark spots when used daily for several months. The key ingredient found in the majority of skin lightening products is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hydroquinone_300063.htm?keyword=hydroquinone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hydroquinone</a>, which works by reducing the amount of melanin produced in the skin cells. While over-the-counter products can contain 0.5 to 2 percent concentrations (2 percent being the most effective OTC amount), prescription-only creams contain at least 3 percent and sometimes even higher. It can take up to six months before you\u2019ll notice an improvement, so don\u2019t give up when you don\u2019t see results in the first week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/video-how-to-apply-retinol-for-the-best-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Retinoids</a>\u00a0have become key ingredients in treating a number of skin disorders from acne to psoriasis, but they\u2019re also effective in treating melasma and skin pigmentation problems. Derived from vitamin A, prescription retinoids contain the active ingredient tretinoin\u2014a form of retinoic acid. This ingredient is often prescribed in the form of a triple cream, which contains three medicines (hydroquinone, tretinoin and a corticosteroid) in one cream to enhance skin lightening, Over-the-counter retinoids are available in many forms, but the key ingredient to look out for is retinol. It\u2019s gentler than the prescription form, which makes it less irritating to the skin. Just remember that it will take longer to see results from over-the-counter retinol products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hydroquinone and retinoid creams won\u2019t be suitable for everyone, particularly those with sensitive skin. Plant-based skin lighteners provide a gentler topical treatment option. Soy-based skin-lightening creams work by limiting the amount of melanin that reaches the surface skin cells. Soy-based products are available over the counter and as cosmeceuticals\u2014cosmetics with medicinal properties\u2014making them particularly appropriate for using on the face.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Kojic+Acid_503556.htm?keyword=kojic%20acid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kojic acid</a>\u00a0is another fungus-based alternative, a natural by-product from the fermentation stage of sake. Studies have shown that it helps to lighten the skin by breaking down melanin in the skin and preventing its production. Keep a lookout for over-the-counter lightening creams containing niacinimide, too. It\u2019s a form of vitamin B3 that works in a similar way to soy-based products, by suppressing the amount of melanin that reaches the upper layers of skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sure, you know that\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm?keyword=sun+care\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sun protection</a>\u00a0is super important, but fail to protect your skin properly and you risk undoing months of hard work from your treatment. Obviously, tanning beds should be avoided at all costs. When exposed to the sun, dark spots become more pronounced. If you suffer from hyperpigmentation, it\u2019s essential to wear sunscreen\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-spf-products-for-year-round-protection/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all year round</a>.

As you tend to your former mole at home, remember that the best care methods\u2014and those ultimately the most effective at reducing scarring\u2014are those provided by your dermatologist or doctor after mole removal. Always be sure to follow their instructions to a T when your skin is on the road to mole-removal scar recovery.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your doctor or dermatologist will, of course, send you home with a dressing over your used-to-be-a-mole area, but when it\u2019s your turn to take care of the spot, start by keeping it clean. All you need for this task is a rinse with clean water and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=gentle%20soap\">gentle soap</a> and a dabbing with a hydrogen peroxide\u2013saturated cotton swab. Once the wound is clean, apply your moisturizing agent and then your covering. Repeat this process at least once per day until the wound heals, to minimize your chances of permanent scarring.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your best bet for keeping a mole-removal wound moisturized is a dab of simple white petroleum jelly. Even if the spot is on an area you\u2019d rather not bandage, keeping the wound covered with petro jelly helps accelerate healing and reduce the potential for scarring. You\u2019ll also need to pay special attention to keeping the spot free from skin-drying sunlight exposure; once the wound has closed and you\u2019re out from under bandages, stay covered with a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=broad-spectrum%20sunscreen\">broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> to reduce your chances of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm?keyword=hyperpigmentation\">hyperpigmentation </a>and visible scarring.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A run-of-the-mill adhesive bandage with an antiseptic pad or a sterile strip is plenty sufficient for keeping small mole-removal wounds covered and on their way to healing sans scars. If your skin is sensitive to adhesives, simply use the petroleum jelly to stick a bit of nonadhesive bandage to your healing wound. As a petroleum jelly alternative that also serves as a cover, hydrogel or <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=silicone%20gel%20sheets\">silicone gel sheets</a>\u2014a proven method for preventing the formation of superficial scars\u2014also do the trick.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sketchy tricks and tall tales abound in the world of scar healing\u2014on the road to recovery, it\u2019s important to know what the potholes look like. Pay no heed to those who encourage open-air healing; it\u2019s a myth, and one likely to stretch out your healing time. Don\u2019t bank on the oft-touted vitamin E, either\u2014it may also slow down the healing process. To avoid scar-sparking inflammation, follow these truths: Steer clear of smoking; avoid alcohol, and stay away from any blood-thinning medicine while the mole-removal wound heals.</p>"},

Here\u2019s Everything You Need to Know</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Dermstore Editors \u00b7 August 31, 2015</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Retinol_300042.htm?keyword=retinol\">Retinoids</a> are the reigning holy grail of the skincare world; you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn\u2019t heard of this renowned ingredient. But with so many persistent myths, most people still don\u2019t know how retinoids work. As one of the most powerful ingredients for reversing the signs of aging, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-reasons-retinol-is-your-best-anti-aging-weapon/\">retinoids are the group you should get to know.</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Vitamin+A_500216.htm?keyword=vitamin%20a\">Retinol,</a> retinyl palmitate and retinoic acid are all types of retinoids, but they are not all the same and vary in strength. Retinoic acid is the only one of the three that directly affects the skin, and it is only available by prescription. The other types of retinoids used in over-the-counter beauty products are still effective, but the process is slower. The skin has enzymes that naturally convert retinol and retinyl palmitate into retinoic acid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinoids, originally used to treat <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm?keyword=acne\">acne</a> and clear blackheads, are still used for that purpose today. Somewhere along the lines, it was discovered that retinoids also had remarkable anti-aging effects. Retinoids not only reverse the signs of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aging+Skin_300045.htm?keyword=aging%20skin\">natural aging</a>, but they can also repair sun damage on the skin. Retinoids have been shown to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, smooth the skin and even the tone. Retinoic acid, specifically tretinoin, also fights teenage acne, but is used for acne in those of all ages and sexes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It does all this by helping the skin to produce collagen, the substance that gives skin its elasticity and youthful appearance. What makes retinoids so unique is that they stimulate cellular turnover in the deeper layers of the skin and actually communicate with living cells to make healthier, new cells. Thanks to this constant turnover, retinoids can treat both sun damage and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u2019s a highly effective anti-aging and acne-fighting ingredient, retinol is a rather unstable molecule that breaks down easily when exposed to light and oxygen. If you see the word \u201cmicroencapsulated\u201d on a product label, it means the formula contains retinol enclosed in tiny, invisible spheres that break open when applied to the skin. These capsules protect the retinol from light, heat and air so they don\u2019t degrade as quickly as you\u2019re opening the product. They also control its release and delivery and allow it to penetrate deeper into the skin. Because of its light-sensitivity, always wear sunscreen when using a retinoid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because over-the-counter retinol products do not contain retinoic acid, they work more slowly than prescription-strength forms. However, this can be a good thing for some skin types, especially sensitive skin. The prescription retinoid is very powerful and can cause skin irritation, including redness and peeling. Whether you need the more powerful prescription formula or will benefit from OTC products depends on your goal. If you\u2019re in your 20s or 30s and want to get ahead of aging, an OTC product is likely all you\u2019ll need. But if you\u2019re 40 or older, the prescription-strength formula may be your best bet for addressing fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At first, you should use any retinoid product sparingly to avoid irritation. Start by applying it every other day or night. Use a moisturizer along with retinol to prevent excessive drying. Take note that some people shouldn\u2019t use retinoids, including those with rosacea or eczema.</p>"},

It not only makes a first impression, it also faces an onslaught of outside aggressors every day, like damaging sun rays and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/pollution-and-skin-aging-explained/\">urban pollution</a>. While daily facial cleansing encourages acne-free skin by removing dirt and oil buildup, eating foods rich in key nutrients means health from the inside out. A diet full of nuts, vegetables and fruit provides regular boosts of vitamins A, C and K, along with healthful, protective fats. Some research has suggested that certain foods containing nutrients and other bioactive compounds may help fend off age-related damage like fine lines, dark spots and acne inflammation. See which foods to start snacking on today.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Next time you make a smoothie, go heavy on the colorful berries and your skin will thank you. Blueberries, blackberries and strawberries are high in <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">vitamin C</a>, vitamin K, folic acid and tannins. That blend of immune-boosting ingredients encourages collagen production and limits inflammation, which means better cell turnover and brighter skin. Skin cells also need a regular boost of regenerative vitamin C, which stops dark-spot-inducing free radicals\u2014from sun damage and dry skin\u2014in their tracks.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These juicy dietary staples contain a slew of skin-protective and healing properties. They deliver a healthy dose of vitamin A, which is a crucial nutrient required for producing healthy new skin cells to replace old or damaged ones. Tomatoes also contain high levels of vitamin C, which fights off free radicals and encourages higher collagen production; meaning skin heals more efficiently and keeps age spots at bay. Tomatoes also contain lycopene and beta-carotene, both of which help protect skin against free radicals from sun damage and the resulting of dark sunspots.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dry skin comes with a laundry list of problems, including inflammation and skin cell damage, which can leave behind unwanted discoloration and make skin more vulnerable to breakouts. Fortunately, a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-foods-you-didnt-know-are-great-for-your-skin/\">healthful intake of nuts</a>, like almonds, walnuts, pistachios and pecans, can give your skin a lift. These little nuggets are packed full of healthful, essential fatty acids, which help skin create a protective barrier against outside acne-inducing intruders and keep skin moist and supple. Finally, nuts deliver a punch of fiber, protein and phytosterols, which help skin to repair more effectively as it turns over.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re a fan of salmon, tuna and mackerel, then you get a boost of omega-3 fatty acids every time you indulge in your favorite piece of fish. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation throughout the body. They also keep skin hydrated and encourage healthy circulation. These three elements work together to keep cell turnover high and inflammation low, which reduces the appearance of dark spots. They also keep skin hydrated, which builds a natural defense against acne and discoloration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Glowing skin, a strong immune system and good eyesight are lurking in the grocery store\u2019s produce section. Think of any bright orange or green produce and it probably has a high dosage of beta-carotene, which the body converts into skin-brightening vitamin A. Eating plenty of carrots, grapefruit, apricots, squash, dark greens and broccoli delivers this potent vitamin into your body, helping healthy skin cells form and providing a powerful punch of healing antioxidants.</p>"},

There are three main types of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Scars_500215.htm?keyword=scars\">scars</a>: depressed or indented scars, discolored scars and thick or raised scars. While depressed, indented and raised scars are notoriously difficult to fade, getting a jump on minor abrasions, skin-deep punctures and discolored scars before they become permanent is key. A scar\u2019s visibility ultimately depends on how well its wound has healed\u2014to make sure small marks become nothing more than memories, encouraging a healthy healing process is absolutely essential.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A great many facial scars result from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm?keyword=acne\">acne</a>. When you have a breakout, don\u2019t squeeze, pop, pick or otherwise irritate pimples at all, lest you cause permanent scarring. The same goes for scabs\u2014they might not look nice, but they\u2019re nature\u2019s own wound dressing. Picking them prolongs the healing process and increases the chances of scarring. When popped pimples and skin-deep wounds do happen, disinfect them with a cotton swab dabbed in witch hazel\u2014an antibacterial agent that won\u2019t dry out the skin\u2014and wash (but don\u2019t scrub) them immediately with your favorite mild, non-drying facial cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you already have a moisturizing routine in place to keep your skin supple, you\u2019ll be glad to know that moisture is also paramount to healthy healing. When wounds dry out, they form scabs and are more likely to leave scars behind, so keep them moist with an oil-based moisturizer or ointment. Even plain-old petroleum jelly, or moisturizing products that feature it as a key ingredient, do the trick. Be sure to reapply the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Moisturizers_300082.htm?keyword=moisturizers\">moisturizer</a>\u00a0after cleaning the wound daily with a facial cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep healing skin covered after you clean and moisturize it, to speed up the healing process and reduce the potential for scarring. Using a circular bandage or cutting a flesh-toned bandage down to size helps keep healing skin covered, while remaining fairly inconspicuous. Alternatively, you can turn to products such as hydrogel or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=silicone%20gel%20sheets\">silicone gel sheets</a>. In any case, change the bandage or cover the wound every day after cleaning and moisturizing. If your skin is sensitive to adhesives, keep small marks covered with a nonstick bandage and a dab of petroleum jelly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once your wound has healed, continue to follow your regular moisturizing routine, and keep the mark covered with broad-spectrum sunscreen rated at\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_SPF+30-40_500303.htm?keyword=spf%2030-40\">SPF 30 or higher</a>\u00a0to prevent redness and discoloration. Each day, apply a bit of vitamin E oil to your fingertip and gently massage the scar for a few minutes. While\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Vitamin+E_500046.htm?keyword=vitamin%20e\">vitamin E</a>\u2014contrary to popular belief\u2014doesn\u2019t actually fade scars, the oil does serve as a moisturizer and massaging the skin helps break down dense collagen bonds, minimizing the scar\u2019s visibility over time.</p>"},

It turns out, many underlying factors can contribute to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dark+Circles_400059.htm\">dark circles</a>, and sleepless nights is just one of them.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sudden dark circles can plague all women with altered hormone levels, not just the expecting moms. About 10 to 25 percent of women who take oral contraceptives, for example, suffer from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm\">dark spots</a>\u00a0on the space, which may also be near the eye area. Hormones play a major role in skin\u2019s aging,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness+and+Dehydration_503759.htm#expand\">moisture retention</a>, collagen development and thickness, so it should come as no surprise that they can affect the color of your skin, too. Estrogen, progestin and even the placenta\u2019s by-products may be the culprits here.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dark circles can also be a warning sign to go in for a checkup. A relationship between those dark circles under the eyes after pregnancy and\u00a0<a href=\"http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem-61-1-28\">thyroid disorders</a>\u00a0is possible. Roughly 70 percent of women with under-eye circles from pregnancy or oral contraceptive use show signs of thyroid problems. Some side effects include fluid retention or lymph malabsorption, which can dilate the blood vessels under the skin around your eyes, resulting in the appearance of dark circles and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Puffiness_500763.htm\">puffiness</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If dark under-eye circles can\u2019t be attributed to hormone changes or your own medical history, you may simply be too tired or stressed, or may need your iron levels checked. Personal habits and other health problems can affect your skin cells, too. About 40 percent of people who suffer from dark under-eye circles also suffer from lack of adequate sleep, while 50 percent suffer from anemia and 71 percent have high stress. Contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s not actual fatigue that causes racoon eyes, but rather the act of lying down horizontally.

You may notice a sunspot or two on the back of your hand, a dark smudge you\u2019ve had since birth, blotchy patches on your face or even widespread discoloration. No matter where your spots crop up, identifying what type of skin issue you have will help you track down the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm?keyword=hyperpigmentation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">right treatment for you</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the color in your skin comes from pigment-producing cells, which constantly create and manage pigment levels. In skin with dark hyperpigmentation marks, those cells are much more active than they ought to be. They may produce more pigment or cluster more pigment together in one area than is normal for the rest of your skin. When you see light-colored, hypopigmentation marks on your skin, the cells are either less active than normal\u2014falling down on their job, so to speak\u2014or are fewer in number than normal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking at dark patches in the mirror, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation is probably the culprit. Acne, psoriasis, trauma, skin irritation and some medications trigger an immune system response in skin, causing it to redden and swell. Pigment-producing cells jump into action from all the stimulation, and when the inflammation fades, dark spots remain. You can also get progressively hyperpigmented spots on the face and forearms during pregnancy or oral contraceptive use because\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hormones-acne-aging/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hormonal changes</a>\u00a0can also affect pigment production. Freckles and dark birthmarks are also technically hyperpigmentation, although you may not wish to seek treatment for them.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike dark spots, pale or white spots indicate a lack of activity among pigment-producing cells. In some cases, as with the disease vitiligo and its sharply defined pale patches, the immune system accidentally attacks and destroys pigment-producing cells. The disorder is progressive\u2014patches look pale at first, and gradually get whiter. Sometimes the color loss spreads to the hair. Hypopigmentation can also show up after inflammation, infection and overexposure to sunlight interrupt pigment production.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation are both benign skin conditions. If the colors are close to your regular skin tone, you may not even notice the patches at all until you spend a day in the sun, accidentally punching up the contrast between the two colors. Starker differences, however, may send you searching for concealing cosmetics to blend the spots in with your original coloring. If\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/cover-up-skin-concerns-with-makeup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">makeup</a>\u00a0isn\u2019t enough to make you feel comfortable in your own skin, you can also restore your skin to a more even-toned complexion with treatments that target the different causes of hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinoids, hydroquinone, azelaic acid, glycolic acid peels and laser therapy can all lessen the look of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation by helping regulate pigment production in the treated areas. Similarly, pregnancy-related patches respond to the triple therapy punch of hydroquinone, fluocinonide and tretinoin. Other dark spots may respond to chemical peels or cryotherapy, performed by a dermatologist. Light spots, on the other hand, may need topical steroids or UV light therapy to stimulate pigment production.</p>"},

Common facial scars include scarring from\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne+Scars_503613.htm?keyword=acne%20scars\">severe or deep acne</a>\u00a0and hyperpigmentation\u2014caused by sun exposure\u2014genetics, and various skin ailments. Less common scars stem from cuts, scrapes or burns, which can leave noticeable marks that may take forever to fade. Fortunately, you can take action to make them less noticeable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may sound odd to smear\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=onion\">onion extract</a>\u00a0on your skin, but this common treatment has proven effective. They key is to use onion extract\u2014an ingredient in various scar-lightening treatments and available on its own\u2014when your scar is relatively new. It works by reducing overproduction of collagen at the scar site. While collagen is naturally produced in the skin, the fibers are more plentiful and more sporadically arranged in a scar. This results in scars becoming thick, hard and discolored.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Alpha+Hydroxy+Acids_300088.htm?keyword=alpha%20hydroxy%20acids\">Alpha hydroxy acids</a>\u00a0are fruit acids that you apply topically to treat facial scarring and wrinkling. They\u2019re most effective when applied to newer scars, but they can also treat older scars. AHAs work by decreasing brown discoloration, as well as exfoliating the skin to create a smoother surface. You can buy AHAs over the counter, or you can speak to a dermatologist about prescription AHAs that are more potent and efficient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A frequently used and often effective treatment for superficial scars\u2014including acne scarring and hyperpigmentation\u2014is the chemical peel, in which a dermatologist or plastic surgeon places a chemical solution on the facial scar. The solution essentially burns away the top layer of skin, leaving new skin underneath. The peels used for depressed acne scars or \u201cdivets,\u201d are stronger than the superficial peels used for\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm?keyword=hyperpigmentation\">hyperpigmentation</a>. Because of their strength, most require some type of anesthesia.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another dermatologist-administered way to lighten scarring is\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-laser-treatment-for-your-skin/\">ablative laser treatments</a>. These involve minimal pain and a short recovery period, but can drastically improve the appearance of acne scarring, hyperpigmentation and or burns. The laser beams heat the temperature of the dermis and epidermis, which helps remove the top layer of skin while tightening and smoothing the deeper layers. As the most aggressive laser type, it usually only takes one to two\u00a0treatments to see results. The more common type of skin resurfacing\u2014non-ablative laser treatments\u2014do not remove the surface of the skin, but instead, make stronger and better collagen to improve scars and take three to six sessions.</p>"},

It\u2019s not something you can catch, and anything from the weather to allergies can flare it up. But most often, it flares up without any unknown cause. Bottom line, it\u2019s no fun, especially when your face starts to peel from irritation. Following a specific skin care regimen is key, along with taking steps to control the peeling. Avoid the temptation to tug at all costs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your skin care regimen should be ultra gentle. Use a fragrance-free cleanser designed for sensitive skin both morning and night; those with dry skin may wish to skip cleanser all together and simply splash on a little cool water. Follow with a treatment product such as a corticosteroid cream to help treat the itching and inflammation. Lack of skin hydration only exacerbates peeling from <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eczema_400027.htm\">eczema</a>, so finish with a gentle, non-irritating moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When skin is itchy, the natural thing to do is scratch\u2014but that\u2019s the worst thing you can do for <a href=\"http://www.newhealthguide.org/Peeling-Skin.html\">peeling skin</a>. Not only can it increase peeling and lead to potential scarring, but also scratched skin allows bacteria to seep in and become infected. Every time you scratch, the more damage you cause to the protective layer of skin. As this damage continues, the nerve fibers become overactivated, so your scratching actually amplifies the perception of itch\u2014even causing more itch.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To prevent further irritation, pick up products containing colloidal oatmeal, which is excellent for soothing the itchiness associated with eczema. Oatmeal is a triple threat\u2014it banishes dirt, eases itching and moisturizes, all at once. If your scratching is mild, try applying a prescribed topical steroid or fragrance-free moisturizer, but if you\u2019re dealing with a chronic itch, talk to your doctor about taking an oral antihistamine.</p>"},

Whatever the cause, it may be accompanied by at least mild discomfort, so seeking relief ought to be high on your priority list. If persistent redness continues, or if you\u2019re experiencing severe pain, schedule an appointment with your dermatologist as soon as possible. If you suspect that a particular product is causing the redness, stop using it immediately.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may seem a basic solution, but sometimes the easiest answer is the most effective. Rosacea is often uncomfortable and, in some cases, painful. A cool bath or shower or a cool compress applied to your face will provide immediate relief to sensitive skin, and it can reduce redness. This is true for other causes of facial redness, too, including windburn, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sunburn_400032.htm\">sunburn</a> or negative reaction to a product. For particularly painful cases, a dose of acetaminophen, ibuprofen or aspirin can provide longer-term relief while your skin heals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facial redness is usually a sign of inflammation or irritation, including cases of rosacea, acne flare-ups or burns. To reduce the redness, you want to soothe the skin. For some people, regularly applying an aloe vera cream, ointment or gel to your face can be beneficial. The active components in <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aloe+Vera_501108.htm\">aloe vera</a> expedite the healing process by soothing the skin, reducing pain and stimulating skin growth and repair. Look for products that contain Aloe Barbadensis Gel or Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice on the ingredient label.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aloe vera is a commonly used remedy to soothe skin and reduce redness, but there are other natural choices you can try as well. For example, honey reduces inflammation and has antibacterial properties. Feverfew is another natural ingredient that has an anti-inflammatory effect and may be good at reducing redness. Other soothing substances to look for include oatmeal, chamomile, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=cucumber\">cucumber</a> and calendula. Depending on the cause of the redness, dermatologists may recommend anything from cold compresses, sun avoidance, topical steroid creams or rosacea-specific creams.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you wait for your redness to lessen, consider using cosmetics to temporarily camouflage red skin. For example, a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-foundations-for-rosacea/\">higher-coverage foundation </a>can even out your complexion, as can concealer. You can also try a green neutralizer, which balances out the redness in your face. This is, of course, a temporary solution and washes off at the end of the day, but it may provide you some peace of mind.</p>"},

Lurking under the surface of your skin, inflamed acne is the most frustrating kind, as its life cycle lasts longer than your average blemish. But by using these inflammation-targeting and skin-calming solutions, you can feel free to show the world your face again\u2014no sick day necessary.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A pimple is not always a pimple by any other name. Non-inflammatory acne includes <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Treat-Blackheads%3A-5-Dos-and-Donts_1994.htm\">blackheads</a> and whiteheads, while inflammatory acne includes pimples, red pustules and larger lesions that are formed when sebaceous glands flare up. An overproduction of sebum leads to a rupture, which then begins to store bacteria, causing an inflammatory reaction. This inflammation is responsible for redness, swelling and pain associated with acne cysts. The more severe the acne, the more the immune system responds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hydroxy acids\u2014alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) and beta-hydroxy acid (BHA)\u2014are often the first line of defense against acne inflammation. These compounds come in <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm\">over-the-counter topical creams</a>, gels and washes. The antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of benzoyl peroxide, a BHA, make it an effective agent, but since it also induces peeling, it can make skin dry and irritated or cause a burning sensation. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Salicylic+Acid_500034.htm\">Salicylic acid</a>, often included under the BHA umbrella, is also anti-inflammatory, as well as mildly antibacterial and exfoliating, and is generally gentler on skin than benzoyl peroxide. Meanwhile, AHAs like glycolic and lactic acid are exfoliants and keep the surface of the skin clear of debris\u2014reducing the amount of pore-clogging activity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Vitamin+A_500216.htm\">Vitamin A</a> derivatives such as retinoids can also indirectly put a stop to acne inflammation. They help unclog pores, let sebum and bacteria flow out freely, discourage bacteria from growing and inhibit the immune system\u2019s inflammatory responses. Tretinoin is a common type, often used together in combination therapy with benzoyl peroxide or antimicrobial formulas. Watch out for scaling and burning, which sometimes crop up. Topical antibiotics can also help inhibit bacterial growth and reduce inflammation, although they may also cause peeling, itching, burning and dryness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A regular treatment routine to manage and prevent inflammatory acne\u2019s development is all well and good\u2014but maybe you\u2019ve got an inflamed acne breakout today. Ditch the agony of flare-ups with the same products that help prevent them. Apply a small amount of a benzoyl peroxide\u2013based topical product to the breakout area daily to reduce the inflammation. You can even spot-treat individual zits. Follow up with a second topical product that contains salicylic acid or a retinoid for an anti-inflammatory double-punch. If BHA and retinoid products irritate or dry your skin, moisturize with gentler anti-inflammatory products containing zinc, aloe vera, green tea or witch hazel to further reduce the inflammation. Avoid picking or scratching at your acne spots, even if they itch\u2014it\u2019ll just make the inflammation worse.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your acne inflammation is severe and painful, or doesn\u2019t respond to topical treatment, give your dermatologist a call. Inflammation from immune response is not the only cause of swollen acne. You might also be having a hormone overload in your skin, either from stress or a hormone imbalance. Oral antibiotics or contraceptive pills may give your skin the boost needed to kick its acne habit for good\u2014or at least tone it down. If you\u2019re experiencing cystic acne that needs to be tamed, cortisone shots are the quickest way to make it disappear.</p>"},

While the easiest way to fade dark spots is still through in-office procedures, like laser treatments and Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), some people turn to topical skin brighteners to help fade dark spots and even out their skin tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Modern topical treatments often rely on safe and gentle natural ingredients to ease hyperpigmentation. Soy creams, sprays and lotions inhibit melanin transfer, while ellagic acid acts as an antioxidant and diminishes melanin production. The latter might sound severe, but it actually derives from fruits like cherries, strawberries and pomegranates. Arbutin, another berry derivative, also works as a skin-lightening agent, especially at a 3 percent concentration. While it might be the darkest of candies, licorice in the form of licorice root or liquirtin (extracted from licorice root) has a similar lightening effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-hydroquinone-and-is-it-safe/\">Hydroquinone</a>\u2014a time-tested crystalline compound that curbs melanin production\u2014serves as one of the most prominent skin-lightening agents in the fight against hyperpigmented skin. Most over-the-counter formulations come in a\u00a0variety of gels, lotions and creams with a 2 percent concentration, while prescription versions contain higher concentrations. Like soy, the B-3 vitamin (niacinamide) stops melanosomes (packages of melanin) from reaching the upper layer of the skin. If you don\u2019t fear fungus, natural fungal elements lignin peroxidase and kojic acid also make their way into effective topical skin-lightening treatments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even as you incorporate a skin-brightening treatment into your skin-care routine, don\u2019t neglect the basics; daily moisturizing is not only the foundation of healthy skin care, it\u2019s essential to encouraging cell turnover. In other words, keeping your skin hydrated helps your body create new forehead skin cells that aren\u2019t hyperpigmented. In particular, keep an eye out for moisturizers and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/\">serums that feature hyaluronic acid</a> or glycerin that both give skin cell production a hearty boost.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Skin damage left behind by irritation and inflammation can lead to hyperpigmentation, so if spots appear on your forehead, follow your mom\u2019s old advice: Don\u2019t touch it. Otherwise, picking or scratching can lead to long-term skin discoloration. Whether you seek to prevent future hyperpigmentation or treat current dark spots, always protect your forehead\u2014and the rest of your face and body\u2014with a powerful, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">broad-spectrum sunscreen</a>.

But as it turns out, this area deserves special treatment to combat typical problems of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dark+Circles_400059.htm\">dark circles</a>, wrinkles, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness+and+Dehydration_503759.htm\">dryness</a> and swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The skin under the eyes has very little fat lying underneath it, and what fat there is, shrinks as you age. Without this fat to plump it up, the skin is prone to wrinkling. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=collagen\">Collagen</a> keeps the skin and muscles taut and springy, but as you age, collagen starts to diminish and you don\u2019t spring back as easily. Facial movements such as squinting in the sun or laughing happen multiple times a day and can cause lines and wrinkles to appear at an accelerated rate. The skin under the eyes is also thinner, and thus more translucent than other skin on your body. As a result, any veins or blood vessels underneath this skin appear as dark circles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The skin around the eyes contains no oil glands, so it\u2019s prone to dryness. During the day, use a moisturizer with sunscreen to help protect this area from sun damage. In the evening, apply an especially rich emollient that doesn\u2019t contain sunscreen; the skin can soak up extra moisture as you sleep. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-apply-eye-cream/\">Apply just a pea-sized amount</a>\u2014the under-eye area is quite small and concentrated\u2014and dab it gently with your ring finger.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To boost your skin\u2019s ability to produce collagen, look for creams with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Peptides_500762.htm?keyword=peptides\">peptides.</a> If you\u2019re plagued by dark circles caused by hyperpigmentation, choose a cream with nicotinic acid, which comes from the B vitamin niacin.

Be careful when you remove eye makeup\u2014don\u2019t rub. Sleep on your back, to discourage fluid buildup underneath your eyes and the look of under-eye bags. Cold items, such as an ice pack, cucumber slices and cold tea bags can also be used to temporarily shrink blood vessels that appear as puffy dark circles.</p>"},

In fact, acne-like breakouts are <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-are-the-Different-Types-of-Rosacea%3F_1935.htm\">subtype of rosacea</a> all their own, differing from other subtypes such as visible blood vessels and thickened skin. Knowing <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Whats-Causing-Your-Rosacea-Flare-ups-And-How-to-Prevent-Them_1916.htm\">what triggers your rosacea</a> is a key part of winning the battle, and while alcohol does have an effect, drinking smartly helps you ward off flares before they happen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While everyone\u2019s individual triggers vary, the majority of those with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Rosacea_27_0.htm\">rosacea</a> report that alcohol consumption causes flare-ups. More than half say that just one drink is enough to cause a reaction, and it can occur even when alcohol is mixed with other substances. That said, even non-drinkers suffer from rosacea, which affects one in 20 Americans. This, of course, deftly dispels the old myth that heavy drinking is the key cause of the condition.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your best bet for preventing alcohol-related skin flare-ups is closely observing which drinks affect you the most. In general, though, red wine tends to have the greatest effect on those with rosacea, <a href=\"&lt;a%20href=\">followed distantly by white wine</a> and beer. Liquor, on the other hand, affects the smallest number of rosacea sufferers. If you\u2019re unsure of what affects you the most, opting for a cocktail is a statistically safer bet than uncorking a bottle of Merlot, but in any case, moderation certainly helps.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think of water as your rosacea-fighting ally, and enlist your ally\u2019s help at the bar. If you choose to drink, opt for drinks on the rocks rather than neat, and have one glass of water for each drink. Good old H20 dilutes alcohol and wards off pH changes, while cool drinks reduce the risk of flushed skin. One of the simplest things you can do to head off a rosacea flare is to drink slowly; slow sipping reduces your cumulative alcohol intake over time. When you pair your drink with food, stay away from common edible triggers\u2014namely, spicy dishes. Instead, go with leafy greens and foods rich in healthy fats (such as salmon or tuna) to keep your skin clear.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While becoming familiar with your personal triggers, knowing how to navigate the drink menu and nursing your drink like a pro all help head off redness in the face, sometimes rosacea flares happen even in spite of your best efforts. When rosacea strikes, turn to topical creams that feature time-tested ingredients, such as over-the-counter metronidazole gel, creams with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sulfur_500043.htm?keyword=sulfur\">sulfur</a> or sulfacetamide, or products with azelaic acid, a form of vitamin C.</p>"},

Between 50 and 90 percent of women develop these lines on their abdomens, breasts and thighs. Whether stretching skin during puberty, pregnancy, extreme weight fluctuations or bodybuilding, know that stretch marks sometimes fade with time. Other skin discolorations, such as scars and freckles, may also disappear as time passes, but certain strategies can help expedite their exit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A chemical peel that uses TCA (trichloroacetic acid) or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">glycolic acid</a>\u00a0can help reduce discoloration. Your body perceives it\u2019s been injured when subjected to these treatments and responds with a healing process that lightens the darkened areas. Such an approach is particularly effective on sun spots as well. At-home versions are milder than aesthetician treatments, and may require multiple applications.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Prescription creams with tretinoin (which derives from Vitamin A) can help reduce the length and width of stretch marks and are particularly effective when used early after the discoloration or stretch marks appear. Tretinoin can be the primary ingredient, or used in conjunction with other stretch-mark treatments like onion extract. While retinoid creams pack the most punch, they can also be used in tandem with gentle exfoliation. Using body scrubs and body brushes help to stimulate the fibroblasts that aid in the production of collagen and elastin\u2014which are responsible for supple and smooth skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many anti-aging ingredients work equally as well for reducing stretch-mark appearance, but there can also be side effects. For those who experience redness and peeling from tretinoin, there\u2019s another alternative in the patented form of vitamin B3 or\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">niacin</a>, called NIA-114. Routinely prescribed by dermatologists to keep aging skin looking younger, this star ingredient has been shown to thicken the top layer of the skin and improve its ability to retain moisture, which can help with stretch marks.</p>"},

It\u2019s up to you to throw the off switch on rosacea\u2019s progress, and that means figuring out exactly what\u2019s happening to your skin during flare-ups.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Whats-Causing-Your-Rosacea-Flare-ups-And-How-to-Prevent-Them_1916.htm\">Pinning down a single cause</a>\u00a0that\u2019s responsible for your\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Rosacea_27_0.htm\">rosacea</a>\u00a0may be harder than you think\u2014even the experts find this one a head-scratcher. External factors like weather, skin irritants and even stress may seem like they\u2019re making your rosacea flourish, but they\u2019re really just incidental triggers. Your immune system, your nervous system and your blood vessels all play an important role in rosacea\u2019s development.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A foreign agent enters your body and brings along with it a series of chemical reactions that respond to the threat, isolate it and eliminate it. Under normal circumstances, all would be well. But with rosacea-prone skin, this defensive response from your immune system may be the root of all the redness. Your immune system may overreact to outside events like heat or sunlight and release too many antimicrobial proteins, which are inflammatory by nature. They can cause redness, bumps and visible blood vessels to appear.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your sensory, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, too, respond to outside forces regularly. But when communication between the nerves in one or more systems goes wrong, chemicals appear when they aren\u2019t necessarily needed and cause some unwanted side effects. The neurotransmitter ATP, for example, primarily stimulates blood flow and dilates blood vessels. It also indirectly causes inflammation and bumps. Lymphatic vessels also respond to nerve communication and cause swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/products-for-rosacea/\">Keeping your skin responses under control</a>\u00a0is the key to a flare-up\u2013free existence. Regular trigger avoidance can help, especially limiting intense sun exposure as UV radiation stimulates the growth of superficial blood vessels. Your doctor may also recommend a variety of anti-inflammatory treatments to calm your skin, or antibiotics to target reactions. While\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Rosacea_400054.htm?keyword=rosacea\">rosacea</a>\u00a0is a chronic condition for most, it\u2019s certainly not without its treatment options, which are constantly being researched by the best and brightest.</p>"},

Hereditary predisposition, dilated blood vessels, thinning skin, discoloration, allergies and skin irritation contribute to these unwanted accessories. While concealer is your best bet to camouflaging their appearance, some topical vitamin treatments, a regular moisturizing routine and a healthy lifestyle may help keep fatigue,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm?keyword=hyperpigmentation\">hyperpigmentation\u00a0</a>and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness+and+Dehydration_503759.htm\">dry skin</a>\u00a0around the eyes at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One culprit behind dark circles is enlarged or dilated veins around the eyes. While\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Vitamin+K_500041.htm?keyword=vitamin%20k\">vitamin K</a>\u00a0supplements have been popularly lauded for the ability to de-puff the eye area by improving circulation, no definitive studies have been completed on this front. However, you can give your topical vitamin K routine a boost with a cream containing a retinol. This ingredient encourages collagen production and new cell growth, which may help give your eyes a fresher, brighter appearance. It won\u2019t hurt to up the vitamin K in your diet with healthful broccoli, cabbage, seaweed and dark greens but these additions won\u2019t necessarily de-puff your eyes or give you glowing skin after a couple days of religiously healthy snacking. Laser treatments at your dermatologist\u2019s office are one of the only proven methods to decrease the visibility of blood vessels more effectively than either diet or topical creams.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Vitamin+C_300098.htm?keyword=vitamin%20c\">Vitamin C</a>\u00a0may provide a boost of brightness and antioxidant power to your face if you have thinning, dry skin or visible veins. Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C helps prevent sun damage and may brighten age or sun spots. The antioxidants in vitamin C may also encourage collagen production and higher circulation for firmer skin. In general, these topical creams can be applied once a day. However, the exfoliating nature of these creams might irritate some sensitive skin types; in which case, try applying the cream every few days. Up your vitamin C intake by eating lots of fresh citrus, red and green peppers, strawberries and broccoli. These foods won\u2019t give your skin a sudden and complete makeover but they will give your overall diet and immune system a healthful boost.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many people struggle with sensitive skin around the eyes, which can lead to irritation, discoloration and that dreaded tired look. That\u2019s where vitamin B3 comes in. Also known as niacinamide, this form of B vitamin boosts the production of fatty acids, which prevents the skin from losing water and retains elasticity. This property helps protect skin that gets easily irritated by sun and pollutants. Niacinamide also lightens age spots, scarring and any areas of heightened pigmentation and can help to reduce fine lines and wrinkles under the eyes. Niacinamide creams can be applied topically morning and evening to reap the full benefits. This protective vitamin has been reported to increase overall energy when incorporated into your diet. Foods like whole grains, dark greens and eggs introduce a healthy dose of B vitamins into your system.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who suffer from hyperpigmentation, age spots or sagging skin, vitamin A is a potent force against signs of aging around the eyes. There are creams that are derived from vitamin A known as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Retinol_300042.htm?keyword=retinol\">retinoids</a>, which come in different forms of concentration. Proven to be the best weapon in your anti-aging wheelhouse, retinoids can achieve powerful results. Retinoids are a triple-threat, enhancing collagen production, smoothing out the skin and evening out pigmentation. While peeling may occur, it\u2019s more of a mild side effect than a true exfoliating action. Because of its potency, this active can irritate the skin around the eyes, so it\u2019s best to start out by applying the retinoid every other day and keep the application light. If your skin responds well to the topical treatment you can apply the product once every evening. Retinoids should be applied at night because sunlight renders the vitamin A inactive, but they don\u2019t make skin any more vulnerable to UV rays than a buffing face scrub would. Adding bright foods, such as sweet potato, carrot, papaya, cheese and eggs to your diet boosts your vitamin A intake. However, your body already stores plenty of vitamin A and these dietary additions won\u2019t make your skin glow, thicken or tighten automatically.</p>"},

You might shy away from peels because they contain \u201cacid\u201d as a primary ingredient, but when used properly, they can do wonders for your complexion by brightening, smoothing and toning the texture of your skin. Get to know the different types of peels to find the right fit for your skin type and condition.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-things-to-know-before-trying-an-at-home-peel/\">At-home peels</a> are similar to clinical-grade versions, but usually feature lower concentrations of the ingredients. They\u2019re also known as superficial peels, because they don\u2019t get as deep and aren\u2019t as potentially risky as clinical procedures. A peel removes the outer layer of dead skin cells to reveal clearer skin that is less affected by blemishes, discoloration and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Fine+Lines+and+Wrinkles_400057.htm?keyword=fine%20lines%20and%20wrinkles\">fine lines</a>. Peels may also <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Large+Pores_500321.htm?keyword=large%20pores\">reduce the appearance of your pores</a> by removing the dirt and sebum, an oily secretion of your skin that clogs and causes them to swell. The primary ingredients in these at-home treatments are trichloroacetic, glycolic, beta hydroxy and mandelic acids. A peel that contains a combination of acids is often best because it\u2019s less irritating than one high dose of a concentrated acid, and multiple acids can work together to provide synergistic effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">TCA, or trichloracetic acid, boasts the same type of acetic acid you find in vinegar\u2014but is far more potent. TCA applied to the skin dries up the top layer of cells so it peels off\u2014this may take days or weeks. The skin that appears from underneath the old cells is smoother and more even in tone. If you have hyperpigmentation due to sun damage or melasma, TCA is usually a good option.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most AHA peels, or alpha hydroxy acid peels, use <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Glycolic+Acid_300087.htm?keyword=glycolic%20acid\">glycolic acid</a> as the primary ingredient. The glycolic acid improves your skin\u2019s texture, rebuilds collagen and can help reduce uneven coloration due to acne, age spots and sun damage. Its small molecules allow it to penetrate deeply into your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A close relation to alpha hydroxy acid, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=beta%20hydroxy%20acid\">beta hydroxy acid</a> features salicylic acid and contains anti-inflammatory properties, so it can reduce the irritation some people experience after a glycolic-acid peel. Peels that contain salicylic acid can help fight acne by drying up excess oil and cleaning out clogged pores. BHA peels are thus useful if you have blemishes or discoloration due to acne. People with rosacea or other sensitive skin conditions may prefer BHA peels, too, because of their gentler qualities.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mandelic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid that is especially effective for clogged pores, blackheads and acne on the face and body. It\u2019s gentler than glycolic acid, so the range in concentrations varies greatly from 10 to 25 percent. Like most peels, it flakes away the top layer of skin to reveal a brighter layer underneath. Mandelic acid peels may also help you fade dark marks and other discoloration over the course of several weeks with a once- or twice-per-week application.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most peels don\u2019t need to be applied daily. Follow the manufacturer\u2019s directions of how often to use them\u2014usually once or twice a week at most. Also, avoid bright sunlight in the immediate days after a peel and always use sunscreen, since the fresh skin is vulnerable to burns. After your peel, it\u2019s important to be gentle to the new layer of skin revealed. Do not exfoliate for at least a week and always start with a low concentration first if you\u2019re new to peels before gradually working up to a greater strength. While at-home peels can give you results, don\u2019t expect them right away. It often takes multiple treatments to see any improvement.</p>"},

Some people\u2019s skin is more susceptible to scarring, while those with severe acne are more likely to scar than others with mild acne. Fortunately, there are a number of treatments for acne scars, including dermabrasion, hyaluronic acid fillers, laser therapy and chemical peels.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An effective treatment for acne scarring, deep chemical peels are typically performed by a dermatologist. These peels often contain one or more of the following ingredients: phenol, trichloroacetic acid and alpha hydroxy acids, among many others. Because every person\u2019s skin is different, the appropriate balance of chemicals is selected by your physician and then administered. The peels remove the top layers of skin, allowing new skin to regenerate, thereby reducing the appearance of acne scars.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Alpha+Hydroxy+Acids_300088.htm?keyword=alpha%20hydroxy%20acids\">Alpha hydroxy acid</a> may be used as the primary ingredient in a professionally administered chemical peel. You can also buy AHA products over the counter, though you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re less potent and therefore take longer to work. AHAs occur naturally, and include <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">citric acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid and more.</a> When AHAs are applied at a very high concentration, they remove the top layers of skin; including dead skin cells, to help create a smoother, firmer complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=beta%20hydroxy%20acid\">Beta hydroxy acid</a>, also known as salicylic acid, is a common over-the-counter ingredient used to treat acne.

BHAs minimize the appearance of hyperpigmentation and can expedite your skin\u2019s healing process.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another acid used to treat PIH is retinoic acid, also commonly referred to as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=tretinoin\">tretinoin</a>.

Most\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Body+Sun+Care_500226.htm\">sunscreens</a>\u00a0contain chemicals\u2014natural or synthetic\u2014and others feature a combination of both. Like most cosmetics, sunscreen can\u2019t always be easily broken down into \u201cchemical\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d categories, but you can certainly explore each item\u2019s contents\u2014and your options\u2014to better understand what\u2019s going on your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The two most distinct categories of sunscreen are chemical and physical. \u201cNatural\u201d isn\u2019t necessarily the best word to describe either, since in general chemicals can be lab-made or nature-found (though not in practice when it comes to sunscreen chemicals) and physical sunscreen ingredients don\u2019t make the \u201corganic\u201d cut. Let\u2019s break it down. Most modern sunscreens feature laboratory-made carbon compounds that chemically absorb the sun\u2019s UV rays. Physical sunscreens, on the other hand, use the minerals zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to reflect sun rays from your skin. These mineral creams used to be known for the white residue they left behind, but nowadays many are processed so they go on clearer, or at least sink in after a few minutes without the whitened tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although mineral-based sunscreens are inorganic, minerals have a rich history of skin care uses and are typically safe. Make sure your physical sunscreen features coated minerals, which helps to stabilize the ingredients. Likewise, stick to creamy mineral sunscreens rather than the spray-on alternatives. Spray products pose the risk of inhaling mineral particulate, while creams often pack the perk of added moisturizers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While no single, all-natural ingredient has been known to block harmful UV rays, they can work in conjunction with chemical or physical sunscreen ingredients to reduce sun damage. Keep an eye out for natural ingredients that help ward off the effects of UV rays, such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Antioxidants_300131.htm\">free radical\u2013fighting antioxidants</a>\u00a0vitamin E, grapeseed derivatives, quercetin and green or black tea leaves. When it comes to decoding your product labels, keep an eye out for inactive ingredients, which can make up about half of the average container of sunscreen and can contain allergens. Common ingredients that cause issues include oxybenzone and the preservative methylisothiazolinone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to sunscreen, one statement garners no debate: Wear it daily and reapply it every few hours. Daily use of sunscreen slows down the skin\u2019s aging process and encourages firmer, less wrinkled and more pliable skin. Stay youthful with an SPF of 30 or above, and choose a broad-spectrum product, which blocks the different types of UV rays responsible for\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sunburn_400032.htm\">sunburn</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aging+Skin_300045.htm\">premature aging</a>\u00a0and skin cancer. When it comes to your morning routine, always apply sunscreen after all your other skin care products and before your makeup.</p>"},

Once these acne lesions develop, you\u2019re not going to scrub them away. You can, however, help fight the development of new blackheads while giving your skin a chance to heal from a current outbreak. The right ingredients enlisted in this battle powerfully cleanse pores, add lightweight moisture and spot-treat problem areas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/salicylic-acid-products/\">Salicylic acid</a>\u00a0is a longtime skin care staple for its ability to unclog pores by cleaning out enlarged follicles that fill with sebum and become blackheads. It may be tempting to scrub at the affected area, but you could end up exacerbating the problem by washing too frequently or too hard. After all, the \u201cblack\u201d in blackheads isn\u2019t dirt that just needs some aggressive scrubbing, but rather the results of a pore clogged with oil and dead skin cells that\u2019s open to the air and oxidation turns it black. Because the ingredient can irritate the skin if used too much, it\u2019s best to use it as a targeted treatment instead of all over your face or body.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like salicylic acid,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Benzoyl+Peroxide_500044.htm?keyword=benzoyl%20peroxide\">benzoyl peroxide</a>\u00a0works as a keratolytic agent, which means it\u2019s able to break down and loosen the dead skin cells on the surface of the skin and down in the pores. In addition to cleaning out pores, benzoyl peroxide fights the bacteria that lead to breakouts. The right concentration targets inflammation without irritating skin. While powerful benzoyl peroxide creams are marketed to teenagers, adult skin fares better with a 2.5 percent cream dabbed on the affected area twice daily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">Glycolic acid</a>, an alpha hydroxy acid derived from sugarcane, gives blackhead-prone skin a fresh start. It goes to work by exfoliating the top skin layer and cleaning out clogged follicles. The benefits of this gentle acid are twofold. By dissolving the upper skin layer, it also triggers the skin cells to repair themselves\u2014therefore creating more collagen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Witch+Hazel_502242.htm\">Witch hazel</a>, which naturally soothes blackhead-prone skin with anti-inflammatory properties, appears most commonly in toners. If your regimen begins with toner, pass on the drying alcohol\u2013based formulas and opt for water-based products. Treatments that dry out and irritate the skin can lead to inflammation, and skin inflammation is a component in the formation of acne.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While cleansing routines and masks soothe facial skin and help create an environment inhospitable to blackheads, you also want to keep a targeted treatment in your arsenal.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/video-how-to-apply-retinol-for-the-best-results/\">Topical retinoids</a>, which are powerful vitamin A compounds, have the distinction of fighting wrinkles and breakouts. Dioic acid (dicarboxylic acid) works by slowing the production of the sebum that\u2019s clogging your pores and battling bacteria.</p>"},

Despite the harsh-sounding name, chemical exfoliants or acids are your best bet for encouraging cellular turnover in this delicate area. Look for toners or lotions that contain alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), beta hydroxy acid (BHA) or glycolic acid. All of these ingredients not only help to soften the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but they also enhance the penetration of other potentially anti-aging ingredients. Applying lotions or toners with these ingredients also help to keep milia at bay if you suffer from the occasional onset.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those looking for products that do all the work for you, look for eye masks that are saturated with active treatments that you place under the eyes. Think of these as a high-tech, targeted version of kicking back with cucumber slices on your eyes. Exfoliating eye peels are gently applied with a fingertip and massaged into the skin. Follow the instructions on the product to determine whether the treatment is meant to be left on overnight or removed after a certain period of time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Give the skin under your eyes a healthy drink of moisture after exfoliation. Pick an eye cream that contains alpha hydroxy acids to plump thin skin and help battle <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Dark-Circles_23_0.htm\">dark circles</a>, or a formula with vitamin C to help brighten skin. You can get anti-aging benefits from a moisturizer that stimulates or protects collagen production, the best being those that contain some form of retinoic acid. Make sure you\u2019re making lifestyle choices that keep the skin around your eyes healthier. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water; get a full night\u2019s sleep, use a daily facial or eye cream that includes sun protection and don\u2019t smoke.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose products specifically tailored for use under the eyes\u2014check labels to make sure there\u2019s no warning against using the product near the eyes. Only exfoliate the skin under the eyes and on the corners where crow\u2019s feet form, not the eyelids or directly under the lash line. Different skin types react differently to exfoliation, and the delicate skin around the eyes is no exception. Use just enough product to get the job done. Make sure you don\u2019t get any in your eyes, and stop if you experience skin or eye irritation or redness.</p>"},

If you\u2019re experiencing a breakdown in your skin\u2019s barrier, what you apply topically becomes more critical than ever. Take a methodical approach to restore, nourish and strengthen your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A damaged skin barrier needs restoration. Step one: Help replace depleted skin lipids by applying oils that are chock-full of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Antioxidants_300131.htm\">antioxidants</a>, such as sunflower and safflower oils, which hydrate with linoleic acid. Beware of heavily fragranced varieties, such as mint or citrus oils, which can irritate sensitive skin. Products containing panthenol\u2014a vitamin B-5 derivative\u2014also work as healing lubricators, as do products with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Niacinamide_503553.htm\">niacinamide</a>, an ingredient that increases ceramide production and restores skin barrier function.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A damaged epidermis requires\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Moisturizers_300082.htm\">moisture</a>, so keeping your face and body well hydrated is critical in the fight to restore and maintain a healthy skin barrier. Reach for creams, lotions and serums that contain moisture-binding humectants, such as glycerin, sorbitol and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyaluronic+Acid_500277.htm\">hyaluronic acid</a>. The latter is also a powerful anti-aging ingredient that locks in moisture and improves elasticity to help you retain plump, youthful-looking skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Harsh chemicals in <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm\">acne-fighting products</a>, over-exfoliation and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Retinol_300042.htm\">retinoid</a> use are all culprits that can inflame conditions like <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eczema_400027.htm\">eczema</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Rosacea_400054.htm\">rosacea</a>. To keep redness and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness++Dehydration_503759.htm\">dry, flaky skin</a> at bay, discontinue use of such aggravating products until your skin heals, and then stagger use of anti-acne and anti-aging ingredients to every other day or a few times a week. Ditch cleansers and toners with astringents altogether, opting for those with calming ingredients like colloidal oatmeal\u2014a natural anti-irritant\u2014to help soothe redness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sun+Damage_500916.htm\">Sun exposure </a>is one of the leading causes of a damaged skin barrier, and continued exposure to UVA and UVB rays impedes skin-barrier restoration. Use a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">broad-spectrum sunscreen </a>with an SPF of 30 or higher every day, and be sure to select one that\u2019s full of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Antioxidants_300131.htm\">antioxidants</a> for anti-aging benefits in addition to protection. You can also work from the inside out: A diet rich in essential fatty acids or an omega-3 supplement can also help nourish and soothe the skin.</p>"},

But it\u2019s still important to know the ingredient list on the back of your bottles. Parabens are used to preserve the integrity of a product, but misinformation persists around these ingredients. That said, informed consumers are smart consumers, and separating fact from fiction is essential to making good skin care choices.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Plenty of noise has been made about a potential link between parabens and breast cancer, and that noise does actually have a source\u2014a much-cited <a href=\"http://www.dr-baumann.ca/science/Concentrations%20of%20Parabens%20in%20Human%20Breast.pdf\">2004 study from the \u201cJournal of Applied Toxicology\u201d</a> found the presence of parabens in breast tumors. But despite the ongoing research this study spurred, no evidence exists to directly link parabens to cancer. Essentially, we know that parabens stay in the bloodstream, but there\u2019s no concrete evidence suggesting that they\u2019re harmful.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.naturalmedicinejournal.com/journal/2010-10/parabens-and-breast-cancer\">In 1984, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review determined</a> that parabens\u2014which are naturally occurring chemicals\u2014are safe for use in cosmetic products up to a concentration of 25 percent; typically, cosmetics feature paraben levels of about 0.01 to 0.3 percent. It\u2019s important to note that there is more than one type of paraben, and the most commonly found types in cosmetics include methyl- and propylparabens. Butylparabens and isopropylparabens are the kinds that have demonstrated greater safety concerns. It\u2019s also known that without preservatives, cosmetics are subject to microbial growth\u2014typically bacteria, mold and yeast. While research on parabens continues, you can be certain that spoiled cosmetics infested with bacteria pose a definite threat.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although individual cosmetic products seem to be in the clear, parabens\u2014just like many natural ingredients\u2014can affect hormone function, which in turn affects breast cancer risk and reproductive health. It is possible, though still unknown, that cumulative exposure to parabens and other ingredients across several personal care products may cause potentially harmful spikes in estrogen levels. It\u2019s also true that while the FDA has found no reason to ban paraben use in the U.S., the <a href=\"https://chemicalwatch.com/19141/eu-bans-five-parabens-restricts-triclosan-in-cosmetics\">European Union does not allow parabens in cosmetics</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Numerous cosmetics makers offer paraben-free products, or those containing preservative alternatives ranging from sorbic acid (a common food preservative) to coconut derivatives. If you do opt for <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/parabens-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">preservative-free products</a>, reduce your risk by paying extra-close attention to the expiration details\u2014these products don\u2019t last as long as those containing parabens, but it\u2019s fairly likely that you\u2019ll go through daily-use cosmetics before they expire. In any case, FDA regulations require retail cosmetics to list all the ingredients on the label, so an informed choice is\u2014oftentimes, literally\u2014in your grasp.</p>"},

Though sunscreens of the past focused exclusively on UVB rays, scientists and dermatologists continue to discover the UVA ray\u2019s potentially harmful effects on the skin. Since UV protection is a cornerstone of any effective skin-care regimen, understanding your opponent is half the battle.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sun emits invisible\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermatology.ucsf.edu/skincancer/General/prevention/UV_Radiation.aspx\">ultraviolet radiation</a>\u00a0in the form of UVA, UVB and UVC rays. While UVC rays never penetrate the ozone layer, UVA and UVB rays do. UVA and UVB rays cause photodamage to the skin, leading to accelerated\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aging+Skin_300045.htm\">aging</a>\u00a0and an increased risk of skin cancers, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Up to 95 percent of the rays that reach your skin are UVA rays, which penetrate more intensely than their UVB cousins. This means they have a greater role in the formation of skin cancer, as well as wrinkles and other signs of aging. UVB rays, on the other hand, are the key contributors of burning and skin reddening. Though they only play a secondary role in photoaging when compared to UVA rays, they\u2019re still a significant factor in cancer development.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Always choose a sunscreen with an\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-spf-products-for-year-round-protection/\">SPF of at least 30</a>, which offers about 93 percent UVA protection. Also seek products labeled \u201cbroad spectrum,\u201d which protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Keep an eye out for effective ingredients such as\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Zinc+Oxide_500039.htm?keyword=zinc%20oxide\">zinc oxide</a>,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Titanium+Dioxide_500040.htm?keyword=titanium%20dioxide\">titanium dioxide</a>, oxybenzone, ecamsule and avobenzone. Don\u2019t reserve sunscreen for days at the beach\u2014wear it every time you venture outside, applying it to any skin exposed at least 30 minutes before stepping into the sunshine, and reapplying every two hours. Your future health and well-preserved skin will thank you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to skin-shielding sunscreen, seek shade whenever possible. Wear clothes that physically block both types of UV radiation, including wide-brimmed hats, sunglasses and long clothes with tight knits in dark or bright colors. For added safety and convenience,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sunscreen+for+Face_504183.htm\">select moisturizers that include SPF protection</a>, and don\u2019t skip sunscreen on cloudy days\u2014energy-packed UVB rays can penetrate both clouds and fog.</p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/anti-aging-for-oily-skin/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">How to Build an Anti-Aging Regimen for Oily Skin</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Dermstore Editors \u00b7 April 15, 2016</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although every anti-aging routine shares some key components, there are a few special concerns to keep in mind if you have <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Oiliness_503761.htm\">oily skin</a>. In addition to preventing sun damage, treating signs of aging and promoting cellular turnover, it\u2019s also helpful to learn more about how oily skin specifically ages before you change up your routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One prevalent myth is that oily skin ages more gradually than other skin types, and does not wrinkle as easily. In truth, oily skin ages just like all other types, but may just <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_4-Surprising-Benefits-of-Oily-Skin_2073.htm\">appear smoother</a> because continued sebum production helps maintain the skin\u2019s texture and natural glow. However, excess sebum makes aging skin more susceptible to conditions such as acne and rosacea, and may lessen the effectiveness of skin resurfacing procedures like laser treatments. In the end, factors such as sun damage and the amount of collagen and elastin in your skin have a bigger effect on its appearance as you age than the amount of sebum your skin produces.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisturizer is one of the most effective anti-aging products on the market, but people with oily skin may be hesitant to use it because they fear it will only make their skin shinier. The solution is to find an oil-free moisturizer that\u2019s not heavy or greasy. Try a water-based lotion, gel or serum instead of a thick cream. Also look for products with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyaluronic+Acid_500277.htm\">hyaluronic acid</a>, which works double-duty to lock in moisture and fight signs of aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have oily skin, getting sebum production under control can help your complexion age gracefully. While harsh, drying cleansers may make your skin feel better after use, they\u2019re only a temporary fix and can actually increase oil production as the skin overcompensates after being stripped of its natural oils. For the long term, use a foaming cleanser that contains a gentle exfoliant, such as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Salicylic+Acid_500034.htm\">salicylic acid</a>. This can help unclog pores and remove layers of built-up dead skin, making your face look smoother and brighter. Witch hazel can also help control oil production and is gentler to the skin than alcohol-laden toners.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sebum in oily skin is an inflammatory substance that can (in excess quantities) stimulate an immune response, such as swelling or irritation. Aging skin tends to be thinner than younger skin, which may worsen the problem. One solution is to use antioxidants, which act as inflammation blockers. When choosing <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Anti-Aging-Techniques-Using-Exfoliation-and-Antioxidants_1951.htm\">topical antioxidant products</a>, look for lightweight formulas packed with active ingredients. Not all antioxidants in skin care pack the same anti-aging punch. Look for products with vitamins A, C and E, resveratrol or extracts from green tea, coffee, grapeseed and pomegranates\u2014to prevent further damage.</p>"},

A cluster of tiny needles in this device pricks the skin in order to tell the body to create more collagen. While microneedling has shown immense promise for some skin concerns, the treatment has a few downsides as well. It\u2019s important to weigh them both before starting treatment at the doctor\u2019s office or at home.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many suffering from acne scarring swear by the ability of microneedling to affect real change on their faces. A\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840919/\">2009 study published in the Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery</a>\u00a0focused on 36 test subjects with varying degrees of scarring over the course of at least three microneedling treatments. Thirty-four of those patients had marked improvement in the appearance of their scars with no permanent adverse side effects. More than 80 percent graded the treatment as \u201cexcellent.\u201d Microneedling can also be used to fade the appearance of stretch marks, lessen scarring from burns and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Microneedling also works on any skin tone, since the risk of pigmentation issues after the procedure is low\u2014depending on how deep the microneedling goes. Microneedling can be done very superficially or very deeply.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Microneedling is generally considered a low-risk procedure, but that\u2019s dependent on a home device being properly calibrated and used correctly. Needles longer than half a millimeter and bent needles increase scarring risk and also invite infections. Longer needles also hurt more. The redness after treatment can last a few days and there\u2019s increased sensitivity to the sun post-treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending on the type of microneedling treatment you receive, recovery can take as little as three days after a procedure at the doctor\u2019s office, whereas laser-resurfacing recovery can take up to a week or more. It\u2019s also more affordable than some of the pricier laser-resurfacing treatments. Home microneedling devices range from $20\u2013$50 or more, while treatments at the doctor\u2019s office are typically $400 a session. Compare that to the average cost of laser skin resurfacing, which is $2,000 for ablative and $1,000 for non-ablative, and can add up if you need multiple sessions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if it\u2019s done correctly and consistently, results won\u2019t be seen until the new collagen has time to grow, which usually takes about six weeks. The recovery time for treating scars created by burns can also be slow. It can take up to a year after beginning treatment to show results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">High-quality, well-maintained at-home microneedling devices are essential to keep skin healthy. In addition to skewed needles on poor-quality devices that can hurt your skin, dull needles can also leave you with damage. Poorly cleaned devices can invite infection. Guidance from a professional on which\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/daily-skin-care-routine/\">topical skincare products</a>\u00a0to use with the device can help avert irritation. It\u2019s best not to use these devices on a daily basis and opt for once or twice a week; otherwise you risk injuring your skin over time.</p>"},

But life happens, and it can happen unpredictably; if you see your skin start to redden, get indoors or into the shade as quickly as possible and start a comprehensive\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Sunburn_400032.htm\">sunburn care</a>\u00a0routine sooner rather than later.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cold, damp towel your mom used to give you after a sunny day at the beach still works today\u2014this simple trick cools down the skin, providing some much-needed relief in 10- or 15-minute bursts. Similarly, a soothing, cool shower or bath does the trick too. Once out of the tub, pat yourself dry and leave your skin just a little moist before applying your moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you reach for that post-shower moisturizer\u2014a key to helping your body heal and easing dry skin\u2014pick a water-based emollient that contains skin-soothing\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Aloe+Vera_501108.htm\">aloe vera</a>\u00a0or soy, as well as skin-strengthening vitamins C or E. Steer clear of potential irritants such as lidocaine or benzocaine, and avoid petroleum, which smothers skin and traps in heat. Throughout the day, increase your water intake to keep your body hydrated inside and out\u2014feel free to spice up your hydration with juice and sports drinks too. For particularly painful spots, a bit of nonprescription hydrocortisone cream can be a big help, while anti-inflammatory ibuprofen cuts back on discomfort, redness and swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Never pick or pop blisters that occur as a result of sunburn. As unsightly as they are, blisters actually help along the healing process and shield your skin from infection. Likewise, don\u2019t scrub your skin roughly or peel away dry patches, both of which are bad habits that prolong the healing process. Avoid further sun exposure as your skin recuperates. If you do step outside, cover up with long, tightly knit clothes and a wide-brimmed hat, and apply a moisturizing sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A bad sunburn may be a sign that your UV-protection routine isn\u2019t up to par. In the future, protect your skin with sun-shielding clothing and daily application of SPF 30 sunscreen, reapplied at least every two hours. Use about an ounce of sunscreen for your entire body. If your sunburn makes you feel queasy, imbalanced or weak, visit your dermatologist as soon as possible. Blistering from your burn on more than 20 percent of the body, dry mouth, increased thirstiness, headaches, reduced urination and drowsiness are also signs of trouble\u2014leave the treatment of serious sunburns to the professionals.</p>"},

Start early with treatment to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Chapped+Lips_503760.htm\">nourish the skin</a>\u00a0and block out harmful UV rays. Consider nonsurgical treatments in your doctor\u2019s office depending on the extent of your\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Lip+Lines+_500922.htm\">lip lines</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From lip creams and topical treatments to lasers and injections, there are many different ways to prevent, reduce or eliminate lip wrinkles and lines. We\u2019re highlighting 4 of the most effective treatments to help you obtain soft, plump and younger-looking lips.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Targeted topical treatments for lip lines can give a plumper, smoother appearance to fine lines in the superficial skin layers. Products that<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=collagen%20lips\">\u00a0stimulate collagen production</a>\u00a0and promote cell turnover can help preserve good skin and reverse the trend of skin damage. Lip line creams include ingredients such as peptides and antioxidants that protect skin while delivering their wrinkle-fighting fury. Deeper lines related to muscle contractions may not respond to creams, but those little vertical lines on the upper lip are good candidates for topical help.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A touch of a laser can take years off around your lips. It does so by burning or stripping tissue to stimulate collagen production in the healing process. The type of laser you choose determines how intensive the procedure is, how much healing time is necessary and how effective it is at wiping away wrinkles. Let your doctor know if you have had repeated electrolysis treatments on your upper lip, as the damage to the hair follicles could interfere with healing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For stubborn lines around the lips, it may be best to pucker up to fillers. Injections of hyaluronic-acid gels can plump up those lines instantly with staying power of about six months. If you regularly get treatments, you\u2019ll be able to space out injections even further as the shots stimulate your skin to produce needed collagen. Bruising can last for several days after the treatment and there\u2019s the possibility of the filler not settling right. Avoid poking or rubbing at your face for a day after the procedure and try not to laugh or smile much for several hours afterward.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think about what\u2019s writing those lines in the first place. Is your skincare routine up to par? Pay attention to the skin around your lips when using a gentle, hydrating facial wash and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=exfoliating%20scrub\">alpha-hydroxy exfoliation</a>. And always protect your skin\u2014without neglecting your lips as well as the skin around your mouth\u2014before heading out the door. Ultraviolet rays weaken the collagen, leaving damaged skin vulnerable to developing lip lines. Use products formulated for facial skin with at least SPF 30 around the mouth and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-lipstick-sunscreen/\">lip balm with the same sun-protection factor</a>. Shield your face with a wide-brimmed hat and seek shelter during midday when the sun is most intense. Remember that the UVA spectrum responsible for wrinkles can pass through glass, so don\u2019t count on a window as your sunscreen.</p>"},

These common blemishes often show up in the most uncomfortable places, such as the armpits or bikini area, after a fresh shave. But don\u2019t let them stress you out. Ingrown hairs are normal and benign, and you can treat them with a few simple methods, or prevent them altogether with a careful skin-care routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When shaved hair grows back from the follicle, it has a sharp tip that usually curls a bit at the end when the hair is fully grown. When the pointy tip of the hair grows back into the skin, it causes a distinctively rounded, discolored bump to appear. These little bumps may occur in clusters, and each bump sometimes sports a pinpoint of hair in its center or a harmless, pimple-like bump. Because coarse, sharp-tipped hairs are more likely to become ingrown, you\u2019ll most often spot ingrown hairs in recently shaved, waxed or plucked areas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those with thicker hair are more susceptible, but ingrown hairs happen to almost everybody. To prevent their formation, wet your skin thoroughly with warm water before shaving to help soften hair. When shaving, use a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hair+Removal_300027.htm\">lubricating cream or gel</a>\u00a0and always shave in the direction of the hair growth to prevent the hair from growing back into your skin. If you use an electric razor, don\u2019t press it up against the skin, and shave in a circular motion. No matter what type of razor you use, leaving just a millimeter or two of stubble helps ward off ingrown hair. Though they come with a much greater investment, laser hair removal and electrolysis procedures serve as more intensive, longer-term solutions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If left alone, ingrown hairs often fade away on their own, but you can easily nudge the process along a bit. If ingrown hairs become inflamed or irritated, gently cleanse the area with an\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cleansers+and+Exfoliators_503724.htm\">exfoliating wash</a>. If the hair is readily visible, wipe the affected area down with rubbing alcohol, and use sterilized tweezers to gently pluck out the hair. Use this tip sparingly, though, because frequent tweezing can damage the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In rare cases, irritation or a buildup of dead skin cells cause ingrown hairs to become infected, which leads to swelling, minor pain and inflammation. When this happens, take a trip to your dermatologist. Typically, your doctor will recommend a tretinoin or steroid cream to help reduce skin plugging and thin out dead skin cells that worsen the effects of ingrown hairs. Otherwise, the dermatologist may prescribe a topical or oral antibiotic to ease the infection, or even remove the ingrown hair by making a small incision in the skin.</p>"},

Although it has no official definition, most companies use it to refer to ingredients that occur in nature and are not synthetically derived. \u201cNatural\u201d ingredients are not necessarily healthier or more effective than synthetic ingredients\u2014but a few of them, such as glycerin, witch hazel and certain <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Anti-Aging-Techniques-Using-Exfoliation-and-Antioxidants_1951.htm\">antioxidants</a>, can provide especially outstanding benefits for your skin. While new ingredients are constantly being introduced into the skin care world, here are a few that have proven time and time again of their potency in skin care.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A very common ingredient in moisturizers, glycerin can be either natural or synthetic. Natural glycerin is derived from animal or vegetable fats, and synthetic glycerin is derived from petroleum. Also called glycerol, glycerin is a humectant compound that occurs naturally in our skin. In addition to its antimicrobial properties, glycerin can improve skin hydration and skin barrier function, help guard against irritants and help wounds heal faster. Glycerin is particularly beneficial for people who suffer from dry skin and conditions such as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-you-have-red-itchy-flaky-skin/\">atopic dermatitis</a>, which compromises skin barrier function.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Native to North America, witch hazel is a botanical anti-inflammatory that\u2019s been the subject of numerous medical studies for its medicinal effects. According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4025519/\">2014 study in The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology</a>, witch hazel contains anti-inflammatory chemicals called tannins that naturally constrict body tissues\u2014which results in an astringent effect on the skin. This is why it\u2019s often in skin toners designed for controlling oil on the skin. Witch hazel is as effective as over-the-counter pharmaceutical products in treating skin irritation, and its antioxidant properties may also help strengthen connective tissue in skin and blood vessels.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to anti-aging, you want the full spectrum of antioxidant-rich vitamins at your disposal to counter the signs of aging skin, such as wrinkles, sun damage and dark spots. Sea buckthorn berry oil boasts an impressive nutritional profile, containing over 190 nutrients and phytonutrients, including essential fatty acids, vitamins A and E and 15 times the vitamin C content of an orange. Vitamin C by itself may help fight sun damage, but according to research published in 2013 in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3673383/\">Indian Dermatology Online Journal</a>, it works better in conjunction with vitamin E, which increases its potency.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a natural moisturizer with binding properties to water, oatmeal is commonly used to treat dry and sensitive skin. It\u2019s unlikely to irritate skin or cause an allergic reaction\u2014part of the reason why it\u2019s so popular in skin care products. As opposed to the cooked oatmeal you might eat for breakfast, colloidal oatmeal is more finely ground\u2014basically the same as oat flour. In addition to its moisturizing properties, colloidal oatmeal is also known for its ability to cleanse and soothe inflammation. Creams and other products containing colloidal oatmeal are very effective for people with dry skin. Multiple studies have shown that the chemical composition of oatmeal is not only beneficial for soothing skin irritation and itch, but retaining skin moisture and thereby helping to maintain healthy skin barrier function. It also has a low irritant potential, so it\u2019s great for sensitive skin and can even help with eczema and atopic dermatitis.</p>"},

While many people can have a skin reaction at some point or another to a product or ingredient, those with persistent issues are classified as having sensitive skin. Check out these 10 signs to see if your skin needs some extra care.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Redness is a common sign of sensitive skin, whether the culprit is a genetic predisposition\u2014like rosacea\u2014or just a reaction to certain ingredients. Those with truly sensitive skin have this reaction often. Those with only infrequent skin \u201csensitivity\u201d to harsh ingredients don\u2019t meet the designation of sensitive skin, but should avoid anything that routinely causes irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Frequent rashes and tiny red bumps are telltale signs of sensitivity. Be sure to vet any new products by performing a patch test on a small, inconspicuous area. Wait 24 hours to see if a rash develops before applying it to your entire face or body.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether it\u2019s a cleanser, moisturizer, foundation or sunscreen, your skin reacts\u2014and not in a good way. People with sensitive skin tend to have a thinner skin barrier, allowing the ingredients in skin care products to sting or burn. Don\u2019t overload sensitive skin with harsh ingredients\u2014stick with gentle, hypoallergenic products <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/face-cleansing-bars/\">formulated for sensitive skin</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dryness and irritation of the skin are signs of eczema, a type of dermatitis characterized by a leaky skin barrier that doesn\u2019t effectively trap moisture. Scaling and flaking develops the longer the dryness persists. For mild eczema, over-the-counter creams can help but for more persistent flare-ups, a topical steroid can provide relief.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Itchy, taut skin is a symptom of sensitivity easily exacerbated by frequent washing with hot water. Switch to a lukewarm temperature, and be sure to use a gentle cleanser, followed by a ceramide-packed moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You step into the sun without a hat or sunscreen, and the next thing you know, you\u2019re flushed and beet-red. Photosensitivity can cause a skin rash on the face, outer arms and chest. Wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, and avoid synthetic varieties\u2014titanium dioxide and zinc oxide are more agreeable to sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Broken capillaries refer to tiny blood vessels that become visible near the surface of the skin and are often seen on the nose and cheeks. Those with sensitive skin\u2014which is thin and has fewer protective layers\u2014are more prone to having broken capillaries.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may smell good, but scented products are an extremely common trigger for those with sensitive skin. Opt for fragrance-free beauty products, and don\u2019t assume that \u201cnatural\u201d scents will be okay. Typically, therapeutic essential oils\u2014such as cinnamon, clove and peppermint\u2014quickly inflame sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cold, windy days are an immediate trigger for those with rosacea, causing flushing via agitated, swollen blood vessels. Inflamed skin needs calming, so look for products with soothing ingredients like calendula, chamomile and azulene extract.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sensitive, dry skin may produce extra oils to try to compensate for the lack of contained moisture. The result? Easily clogged pores that lead to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Acne_21_0.htm\">breakouts</a>. Wash no more than twice a day with a gentle cleanser, and opt for non-irritating spot treatments such as tea tree oil and witch hazel as opposed to alcohol, benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid.</p>"},

Both treatments share the goal of reducing signs of aging or improving skin appearance. But which treatment is right for you? The answer to this will depend largely on your preferred level of intensity, what you\u2019re looking to correct and the time and cost you\u2019re willing to set aside for the procedure. Understand what each process entails so you can pick the right option for you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Laser resurfacing is a technique that directs short, concentrated, pulsating beams of light at skin to treat skin. Peels, on the other hand, use fruit acids or chemicals with varying levels of intensity to strip the top layers of skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The number of skin conditions that can be targeted with peels is impressive, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Fade-Acne-Scars-Using-Creams-and-Serums_1967.htm\">acne scars</a> and age spots to pigmentation issues and sun damage. While a chemical peel may lessen fine lines and rough skin, the treatment won\u2019t do as much good with deep wrinkles or sagging skin. Lasers tackle skin conditions ranging from sun damage to brown spots or scarring. Some types of wrinkles are better candidates for laser treatment than others, such as lines around the eyes and vertical wrinkles framing the mouth. Texture also benefits from the use of a laser, which can tighten and smooth skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Peels and lasers also come in different levels of intensity. You can choose a light peel that can be done during a lunch break, such as alpha hydroxy acid, or opt for a deeper treatment with a higher concentration of trichloroacetic acid to tackle fine lines, discoloration or rough skin texture. If you\u2019re new to peels, start with a lightweight treatment featuring milder ingredients like lactic acid, mandelic acid and willow-bark acid, and work your way up to more concentrated formulas. Laser resurfacing treatments come in <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-laser-treatment-for-your-skin/\">two different types</a>. Ablative lasers strip away the outer layers of skin, taking wrinkles and problem spots with them. Non-ablative lasers are the less invasive option; these stimulate the skin to produce more collagen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both procedures can be done in your dermatologist\u2019s office or at home. However, both at-home peels and laser devices that are sold over the counter don\u2019t have the same intensity as the treatments delivered in the doctor\u2019s office. Both can also result in side effects\u2014redness, hyperpigmentation or scarring\u2014if not used as directed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A chemical peel does just what its name implies: peels away the outer layers of skin. For those with skin sensitivities, this can pose problems. Some people may experience a change in skin tone on treated areas, which can be temporary or permanent. You can, however, minimize the risks of peels by <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-things-to-know-before-trying-an-at-home-peel/\">choosing the right treatment for your skin type</a>\u2014a lower concentration of active ingredients, for example\u2014and the right treatment for your skin issue, such as salicylic acid to treat acne. The reaction to lasers will vary depending on the person and the type of treatment. Resurfacing treatments in a doctor\u2019s office may leave scabbing and reddened skin for several weeks as the skin heals. All treatments carry a risk of scarring or infection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On average, laser treatments are a more expensive option than chemical peels. The exact price varies depending on the type of treatment, anesthesia used, the experience of the person performing the treatment and more. The average cost of laser skin resurfacing is $2,146 for ablative and $1,062 for non-ablative, according to ASPS (American Society of Plastic Surgeons) 2014 statistics.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though the benefits from laser resurfacing can last a long time, the less invasive treatments may need to be repeated more frequently. Lighter treatments using both lasers and peels will be less expensive than a deep treatment, but the results of the deeper treatment will last longer. You may not even notice the full effect of a laser treatment for months, depending on the depth of the procedure. Even though the deeper peels that use phenol or tricholoracetic acid to reach the middle layer of skin have a recovery time of a few weeks or more, the results can last for up to 10 years.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the average cost of a chemical peel is $706, depending on the procedure and where you live. For example, a mild face peel costs around $100 per application but a Phenol full face peel can cost $3,000 to $4,000. For a deeper peel like Phenol, recovery time is usually around two weeks, whereas light chemical peels that use alpha or beta hydroxy acid have no recovery time at all.</p>"},

Because the FDA doesn\u2019t vet beauty devices for aesthetic results, navigating your options can get a bit tricky. Before you dive into the world of at-home laser devices, immerse yourself in research to help make the right choice for your complexion and skin care goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wand-like laser devices for home use often rely on fractional laser technology, which pierces the skin\u2019s collagen layer, resulting in stimulated collagen and elastin production, increased elasticity and a reduction in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/category_Hyperpigmentation_30_0.htm\">hyperpigmentation</a>. With very regular use\u2014a few months\u2019 time up to five days weekly\u2014fractional lasers help smooth, tone and tighten the skin. Dermatologists also use fractional technology in the office, but home resurfacing devices significantly scale back the intensity. Home devices employ non-ablative lasers, which simply heat the lower layers of skin and leave the top layer intact. This reduces downtime and minimizes risks like infection and swelling. Many of these home-based products are used in conjunction with antioxidant gels, creams or serums to help encourage collagen production after resurfacing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some handheld body-hair removers use laser-produced heat to target the hair\u2019s pigment; after multiple treatments in a row, this damages stem cells and stunts hair growth. These devices often cater to people with light-to-medium skin tones and dark hair. Alternatively, intense pulsed light (IPL) hair removers disrupt hair growth right at the root. A\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921762/\">2010 study from the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology</a>\u00a0reports overall hair reduction of about 78 percent over the course of 16 weeks, with one IPL treatment every other week. Both of these devices typically target small areas\u2014such as the bikini line or underarms\u2014making them a convenient and effective at-home solution for hair removal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike resurfacing lasers, some at-home devices feature light-emitting diodes (LED) to project intense red and blue infrared lights onto the skin.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/anti-aging-red-light-therapy/\">Red LED therapy</a>\u00a0aims to boost collagen production and improve skin tone and works best for people who are struggling with both acne and wrinkles. Also called photodynamic therapy, red LED devices are often used in conjunction with topical ingredients to treat acne or pre-cancerous skin lesions. Another option for those with acne is blue LED therapy, which works by targeting the strain of bacteria that causes breakouts. While at-home devices aren\u2019t as strong as those used by professionals, it\u2019s essential to follow safety instructions and always wear protective eyewear when applying treatments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though FDA approval isn\u2019t required for home-use cosmetic lasers, you can still seek machines that have been peer-reviewed by medical experts. Whichever device you choose, make sure you follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions and warnings, and stick to the recommended routine; even the most effective products won\u2019t meet their potential without proper, regular and continued usage. Everyone\u2019s skin is unique, so always test your new product on a small patch of skin before committing to use.</p>"},

Even with the skillful hands of a surgeon, a cosmetic procedure still constitutes a type of trauma from which your body must heal. In addition to following all post-care recommendations provided by your doctor, there are a few things you can do to ensure a speedy recovery.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surgery\u2014even minor procedures and some injections\u2014makes your body react as if it\u2019s been injured. Your body can\u2019t distinguish between falling down and scraping your knee and a doctor taking a scalpel to your chin. Fluid rushes to the \u201cinjured\u201d region, causing swelling. Bruising occurs as the surgery causes tiny blood vessels\u2014known as capillaries\u2014to burst. The blood from these vessels sits right below the skin\u2019s surface, creating blue, black or purple discoloration. The extent of your bruising depends on the procedure and the methods used by your surgeon. Even some injections, especially those done at the lip area, can cause bruising. Bruises generally last seven to 10 days, but can hang around for as long as three weeks.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep all dressings and compresses on the wound site until your doctor tells you to remove them. Your doctor may suggest an application of Vaseline to the surgical site; massage it in gently to prevent pain associated with the bruises. If you had a procedure performed on your face or neck, sleep with your head elevated about 45 degrees for the first few weeks. While this doesn\u2019t directly heal any bruising, it does help reduce the swelling that can make bruising appear worse. Apply ice packs to the bruised area, if approved by your doctor. This helps shrink blood vessels and may lighten the black-and-blue hue. Avoid heat, as it will open up the blood vessels and make your bruising appear more extensive. If you have a lot of redness around the site of the procedure accompanied by pain and fever, or the treated area feels hot, contact your doctor immediately. This could be a sign of infection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take care of yourself <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Recovery-Tips-for-Post-Cosmetic-Surgery_2000.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post surgery</a> to allow your immune system to work its best. Don\u2019t smoke for at least a week, and avoid drinking alcohol for the first 48 hours after the operation. Certain anti-inflammatory medications and aspirin can worsen the appearance of bruising, as well as cause bleeding; ask your doctor what you can take for pain. Keep the bruised areas out of the sun, since this can deepen their color. Stay fully hydrated after your surgery to encourage a reduction in swelling and avoid strenuous activity in the first few weeks after surgery to support healing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Resuming normal activity soon after surgery is essential to promote healthy circulation and discourage the development of clots. Get up and go to the dinner table; leave your bed, even if the bruising makes you self-conscious. After a couple of days, it should be fine to apply makeup to mask bruising. Clear this with your doctor first, and stay away from open wounds or stitches. In some cases, your doctor may even offer a special, camouflaging makeup to cover the bruising.</p>"},

In addition to plenty of topical skin care products, at-home laser technology\u2014which has made a successful transition from the dermatologist\u2019s office\u2014can help minimize these issues and make pores less noticeable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Intense pulsed light (IPL) is a popular technique for reducing the appearance of pores, both <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-do-dermatologists-do/\">at the dermatologist\u2019s office</a> and at home. It comes in the form of wand-like, laser-emitting gadgets. The treatment involves intensively targeted light pulses to stimulate collagen production, which in turn evens out skin tone and reduces hyperpigmentation. By reducing redness, improving skin texture and increasing firmness, IPL devices help ease a variety of the skin issues that call attention to the pores. Photodynamic therapy devices, which come in the form of lighted panels, work in conjunction with topical solutions. These devices project a warm and intense <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/anti-aging-red-light-therapy/\">red LED light</a> onto the face, and the light-activated topical solution reduces the size of the face\u2019s oil glands, helping to prevent the formation of clogged, prominently visible pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No at-home device or in-office procedure can physically change your pore size, but a number of treatments have been proven effective at lessening their appearance. A <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799029/\">2011 study in the journal Laser Therapy</a> found that Q-switched and micro-pulsed lasers visibly reduce the appearance of pores, especially when used with photo-activated topical solutions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Effective skin care calls for a well-rounded regimen. To maximize your results, at-home laser devices should be used in tandem with your normal routine rather than as a replacement. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-properly-exfoliate-skin/\">Physical exfoliation with scrubs or chemical exfoliation with glycolic acid</a> helps keep pores clean, while salicylic acid facial cleansers and regular application of sunscreen help heed off the issues that make pores appear larger over time. At the dermatologist\u2019s office, chemical peels can minimize the appearance of pores by cutting back on excess dead skin cells, while fractional, non-ablative laser resurfacing bolsters collagen production to help reduce the appearance of large pores. As an alternative to laser-based devices, some home-use devices employ sonic vibrations to exfoliate the skin, sloughing away dead skin cells that clog pores and make them appear larger.</p>"},

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease that causes flares of rapid skin cell growth, resulting in raised skin lesions that can be red, scaly and itchy. The rash isn\u2019t contagious, and the condition often develops between the teenage years and the mid-30s.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dry skin can be caused by anything as simple as a shift in the climate to over-washing your hands during a cleaning binge. It can also reflect prescriptions you\u2019re taking or underlying medical conditions such as poor nutrition, hormone imbalances, thyroid disease or diabetes. Psoriasis can be inherited\u2014about one-third of those with psoriasis have a relative with the condition. The immune system also plays a strong role, though researchers have yet to pinpoint exactly what causes some to get psoriasis while others don\u2019t.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think back to the last harsh winter you experienced or a summer spent in the air conditioning, and you can easily recognize the signs of dry skin. It can feel rough, and look dull and parched. If left untreated or exposed to particularly harsh elements, it can get even more irritated and crack or peel. The most common type of psoriasis shows up as reddened and raised plaques. It can be mild to severe, with different degrees of pain or itching. Other types of psoriasis are reflected in symptoms including smooth red rashes in skin folds, blisters or peeling skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best treatment for dry skin is prevention: Stop it before it starts by regularly applying a heavy moisturizer, cleansing with mild soap or using a humidifier to counter dry spells. If home treatments aren\u2019t doing the trick, a dermatologist can recommend stronger creams or even prescribe you an antihistamine. If your psoriasis is mild\u2014defined as occurring on less than 3 percent of the body, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation\u2014topical treatments such as a menthol shampoo to control scalp itch or moisturizer with salicylic acid may keep the condition under control. More serious cases are usually treated with a multi-pronged strategy that can include prescription drugs and even phototherapy.</p>"},

And, believe it or not, despite the fact that it\u2019s a skin care superpower, salicylic acid is gentle on sensitive and compromised skin types, making it a great choice for anyone seeking a clear and clean complexion.

But it\u2019s not just the leaves though, because every part of this tropical plant\u2014from seeds, flowers, root, even its bark\u2014is known to store numerous phytonutrients, amino acids, and high-value minerals that act as, among others, antioxidants, immune-boosters, anti-inflammatory, as well as lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels.\u2014</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because moringa is highly edible, it is often consumed as part of everyday cooking or powdered and used as a food supplement. But another way to get the most out of this \u201cmiracle tree\u201d is by extracting oil from its seeds, which offers a plethora of benefits for the skin, including countering the effects of free radicals. \u201cMoringa oil or ben oil has plant hormones called cytokinins that help promote cellular growth and prevent destruction of skin tissues,\u201d says nutrition, beauty, and aromatherapy expert Janice Rosenthal, founder of <a href=\"https://gardenofessences.com\" target=\"_blank\">Garden of Essences</a>. \u201cThe natural vitamin C in moringa oil boosts collagen, helping reduce fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The vitamin-rich and nutrient-dense moringa oil makes for an excellent active ingredient in skin-care products, thanks to its antioxidants, antibacterial, and nourishing properties. Its high concentration of behenic acid (thus the name \u201cben oil\u201d) makes moringa oil a top anti-aging weapon, and the fatty acid\u2019s deep moisturizing properties also offer added benefits for the hair.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But it doesn\u2019t stop there.

Removing every trace of dirt, sweat and makeup allows the skin to breathe, repair and renew itself. Having a spotless surface also helps your other skin care products to penetrate your skin more deeply and perform their tasks more efficiently. As the first step in your skin care ritual, it\u2019s important to nail this part before even thinking about your serums and anti-aging creams.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With so many cleansing options available, and with each one touting different benefits, it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed and get swayed by false marketing claims. Knowing the difference between each type allows you to filter your options and makes the hunt for the perfect cleanser a whole lot easier. If you have a normal skin type, feel free to try any type of cleanser as long as your skin tolerates it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gel cleansers are clear and, as the name suggests, have a gel-like consistency. Generally designed for deep cleansing, they are effective at decongesting clogged pores, removing excess oil and killing acne-causing bacteria, thanks to their antiseptic and exfoliating properties.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cream cleansers are usually thick, creamy and contain moisturizing ingredients like botanical oils. They gently cleanse your skin without stripping it of its natural oils. Cream cleansers can also come in the form of \u201cmilk\u201d or \u201clotion.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Foam cleansers are lightweight cleansers that start out as cream or gel and burst into a rich, foamy lather. This type of cleanser removes excess oil as effectively as gel cleansers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Washing your skin with oil may sound like a recipe for breakouts, especially if you have oily skin, but most experts disagree. An oil cleanser is a gentle way of removing pore-clogging debris\u2014including waterproof makeup\u2014without drying your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Known for their absorbing power, clay cleansers purify your skin by drawing out excess oil and toxins from your pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Originating in France, micellar waters feature \u201cmicelles\u201d\u2014or tiny oil molecules suspended in soft water\u2014that attract oil, dirt and makeup. Another great thing about them: You don\u2019t need to rinse them off with water.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Powder cleansers are nothing new, but they certainly are having a big moment right now. These cleansers\u2014powdery soft when dry\u2014disintegrates into a creamy concoction upon contact with water, thoroughly cleansing your skin while providing gentle exfoliation. Unlike traditional physical exfoliants like beads and scrubs, powder cleansers glide smoothly on your skin, so you can use them every day even on sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After years of staying out of the skin care spotlight, bars are slowly sneaking back in. These\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/face-cleansing-bars/\">new breed of bars</a>\u2014some contain very little soap, others have none at all\u2014are just as skin-friendly and luxurious as their liquid counterparts. They also\u00a0offer more skin-friendly pH levels in addition to nutrient-rich, highly moisturizing ingredients, such as glycerin and essential oils. Extra points for being a greener choice than liquid soaps because the packaging materials\u2014primarily paper and cardboard\u2014break down more easily in landfills than plastic packaging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are cleansing wipes, and then there are cleansing cloths, mitts and sponges. These cleansers are made with special fibers\u2014some are plant-derived and don\u2019t typically require the use of any traditional cleansers\u2014to thoroughly remove impurities while also sloughing off dead skin cells. A few examples are muslin cloths, kassa/kessa mitts and konjac sponges.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts have different opinions about how often you should wash your face. Our advice? Listen to your skin. Some skin types can benefit from a twice-a-day, morning-and-night cleansing routine to control excess oil and shine, while the same routine can make others dry and tight. As a general rule: Wash your face at night, and never sleep with your makeup on. Here\u2019s an easy step-by-step guide on how to wash your face properly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>STEP 1: REMOVE YOUR MAKEUP<br>\n</strong>Choose your poison. Some people prefer a traditional oil-based makeup remover, while some opt for a cleansing oil, a micellar/cleansing water or cleansing wipes. This step is particularly important if you wear waterproof makeup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>STEP 2: WASH YOUR FACE<br>\n</strong>Place a small amount of your chosen cleanser into your hands and emulsify with lukewarm water. Massage it onto your skin using circular motions for at least 30 seconds. Make sure you cover a lot of ground, including commonly missed areas like along the hairline, below your ears, the front and back of your neck and your d\u00e9colletage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>STEP 3: RINSE AND PAT DRY<br>\n</strong>Remember to rinse your face with warm water, not hot. Once done, gently pat (instead of rub) your skin with a clean, dry towel.</p>"},

These products are formulated with greater amounts of active ingredients, and because they are generally lighter than your traditional face creams, they can penetrate your skin deeper to truly make a difference. Typically applied daily as the last step before moisturizing your skin, these products are versatile and can be used in numerous ways: They can be added to moisturizers, night creams and masks to enhance their potency, used as a spot treatment for problem areas, or utilized as a stand-alone hydrating gel for oily skin. With continued use, serums offer visible results that may not be realized with most creams and lotions alone. There truly are serums for every skin condition. Here are just some of them.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best anti-aging face serums out there feature ingredients that speed up cell turnover, boost collagen production and improve your skin\u2019s elasticity.

While these psoriatic skin lesions can sometimes be sore or \u201cburnt,\u201d they are typically less itchy than eczema.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Typically, psoriasis appears in adulthood as opposed to eczema which emerges in young children (85% of cases appear by age one). Psoriasis classically favors the outside part of the elbows and knees, but may affect other parts of the arms and legs as well as the face, buttocks, armpits and groin. Involvement of the scalp (mild dandruff or red scaly plaques) and nails (small pits or brown stains, or separation of the nail from the nail bed) is common in psoriasis but not eczema.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Guttate psoriasis is a variant of psoriasis that presents with smaller plaques in an eruptive pattern associated with strep infection. \u00a0In psoriatic arthritis, joint pain and stiffness develop. Flare-ups of psoriasis, in general, can be triggered by stress, skin trauma, and certain medications.\u00a0It is not contagious.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Treat Psoriasis</strong>: While there is\u00a0no cure for psoriasis, effective treatments do exist.\u00a0Steroid and vitamin D creams are usually the first treatments attempted. \u00a0In moderate to severe disease, light treatment (phototherapy) and systemic medications (whether by mouth or injectable) are considered.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition caused by a hypersensitivity reaction. \u00a0Eczema usually first appears in childhood, and the majority outgrow the condition by their teens. \u00a0There is usually a family history of eczema\u00a0and a strong association with asthma and hay fever. Like psoriasis, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/eczema-what-is-it/\">eczema appears red and inflamed</a>. However, eczema is dramatically itchier and less likely to be covered with thick silvery scale. Instead, it can appear dry, cracked, peeling, bumpy, blistered or raw.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eczema likes to appear along the inner part of the arms and behind the knees (the folds), which is the opposite of where psoriasis prefers to develop.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Treat Eczema</strong>: Stress can worsen eczema just like psoriasis. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-Causes-Eczema_1900.htm\">Other eczema triggers</a> include inadequate moisturizing (dry skin), the use of harsh soaps, detergents or other personal care products, as well as environmental allergens and exposure to cold, dry conditions. Avoiding these triggers as well as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eczema_400027.htm\">keeping your skin adequately moisturized</a> are key to keeping eczema at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Contact dermatitis mimics eczema with the appearance of red, itchy, irritated skin caused by environmental triggers.\u00a0 It can appear on anyone, including those without a history of atopic dermatitis. \u00a0 Allergic contact dermatitis is a hypersensitivity (immune-mediated) reaction, and the most common causes are fragrances, nickel exposure, rubber or other chemicals. \u00a0Irritant contact dermatitis is not a hypersensitivity reaction.\u00a0 It is caused by direct skin injury from a physical or chemical irritant (most commonly excess hand washing or harsh soaps)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Treat Skin Allergies:\u00a0</strong>Irritant or allergic contact dermatitis is treated similarly to eczema. Sometimes skin allergy or patch testing is needed to identify the offending allergen(s). Removal of the responsible irritants or allergens should lead to full clearance, unlike eczema which is chronic and can be expected to come and go periodically.</p>"},

Blame it on a lone gray hair that found its way to your locks, or a nagging, fine line that you\u2019re anxious will turn into a profound indent. But according to experts, the more that you do to address your skin issues when you\u2019re younger, the less you\u2019ll have to worry about it as you age. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though not scientifically proven, face exercises have been recommended by massage therapists for decades as a technique to banish those could-be wrinkles before they even form. After all, you make a point to get in your daily sweat sesh at the cycling studio or gym, so why wouldn\u2019t you put in the extra effort to make sure your face is healthy and firm, too? If you\u2019re curious to try t</span>hese face exercises yourself, here are a few you can try to maintain your skin\u2019s elasticity for years to come:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever seen a facelift fail, it was probably because the skin on the face was tightened while the excess skin on the neck was left alone. Though not noticeable on most women before the age of 45, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/3-ways-to-treat-turkey-neck/\">loose skin around the neck</a> can be troublesome and annoying as you begin to get older. That\u2019s why </span><a href=\"http://www.bitesizepieces.net\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connie Rogers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a certified integrative nutritional holistic health coach, cosmetologist and skin expert recommends this exercise:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cUse an inversion table to hang upside down or lay right side up and hang your head off your bed. This is a form of resistance training. Open mouth wide and tighten your bottom jaw/neck, called the platysma muscles. These platysma muscles are directly connected to the skin,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cPerforming this exercise requires 3 sets of 12, each time holding your jaw up as tight as you can for about four seconds and releasing. These muscles hold the neck and jaw together for a youthful appearance. Benefits include increased\u00a0blood circulation to the face and neck, improved facial expressions, slowing down the aging process, keeping muscles toned, tight and short and preventing turkey neck!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many factors can make those prevalent bags around your peepers more common\u2014from allergies to being hungover (we\u2019ve all been there)\u2014waking up and feeling face bloated isn\u2019t a happy experience for anyone. Over time, those bags can deepen and become less random and more permanent, but luckily, Rogers says keeping this exercise in your anti-aging back pocket can be a game changer. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cFor this exercise, you\u2019ll need clean skin and some moisturizer or <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eye+Cream_300080.htm\">eye cream</a> on your thumbs. Start with thumbs orbiting your eyebrow bone and eye socket bone to make a complete circle around eye, which is going in the opposite direction of wrinkles. Do this 5 times,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe muscles around the eye, brows and lid are called orbiularis oculi muscles and these cover the orbital bone (eyes socket bone) Periorbital skin covers the eyes muscles. This exercise can increase blood flow and oxygen in these surrounding delicate tissues, which then reduces the puffy look. Best results are achieved by drinking more water, decreasing alcohol intake and avoid smoking.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you sip on iced coffee (or margaritas) with an ever-convenient straw, you probably never considered the lines around your mouth that you could be encouraging. While smile lines are nearly inevitable, there are some movements you can whip out to keep your puckers healthy and smooth. \u201cUse a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Trinity+Facial+Toning+Kit_38762.htm\">device that offers a low-level current</a> and work around the orbicularis oris muscle. Start with clean skin and open mouth and tighten your lips around your teeth. Place water-soluble gel on skin and work with roller attachment on skin area for about 3 to 4 minutes. Once you get used to this tiny beauty tool you can work your way up to 5-7 minutes,\u201d Rogers says. \u201cThis exercise/treatment tightens, firms, tones and increases blood supply to connective tissues. It\u2019s safe\u00a0and painless. For faster results, it\u2019s best to discontinue poor habits such as drinking from straws or puffing on cigarettes that can increase wrinkles.\u201d</span></p>"},

From testing the texture and taking a whiff to see if it tickles your nose to watching your skin transform, there\u2019s a reason why shopping for skin care and makeup is,\u00a0well, super fun. The only downside to changing your skin regimen is that your face might not always demonstrate the outcome that you\u2019d hoped for. (Especially if you have sensitive, finicky skin, then you know how it feels to try a trendy-sounding moisturizer and suddenly find yourself completely broken out.)</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To\u00a0guide you through your new skin care journey, we spoke with dermatologist </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse M.D., FAAD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get her best tips on what to expect when trying out a new daily skin care routine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>1. There\u2019s a difference between normal skin reaction and allergic reaction.</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dr. Shainhouse, whether your skin is happy with the new concoction or not, you\u2019re bound to notice a reaction, which can range from mild stinging, burning and itching to red rashes, skin swelling and blisters. \u201cIt can be an expected irritation reaction\u2014like the mild stinging from an acid toner or the peeling and redness from using a topical retinoid,\u201d Shainhouse says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An actual allergic reaction, in contrast, could be painful and long-lived, instead of a mild bout of side effects. If you\u2019re ever concerned, stop using the product immediately and call your dermatologist ASAP. \u201cIf a product stings your skin, wash it off. Beauty does not equal pain in this case. You can try the product again in a few days, and see if your skin can tolerate it,\u201d Shainhouse says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>2. Give your skin time to ease into your new regimen.</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When starting out a new product or regimen, Dr. Shainhouse says to pay close attention to how your skin is talking back to you. Check for dry skin, flaking, redness and of course, acne. \u201cIf your skin becomes dry, red and irritated from a product, and this can be an expected result from certain products like acne creams and topical retinoids. Reduce the frequency of use: Start one to three times a week. Give your skin a few days between applications to get used to it,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>3. Most active ingredients take at least 2 months to show results.</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you have a first date that doesn\u2019t rock your socks, but you enjoy the texting afterward, so you agree to meet for drinks again. Just like you might give a potential match another chance, the same mantra and attitude apply to the products you\u2019re trying on for size. The only difference? Dr. Shainhouse says patience is key: \u201cMost skin care products with active ingredients can take about two months to show efficacy. These include topical antioxidants, retinoids and pigment-fading creams,\u201d she says. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>4. In some cases, tingling doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s working.</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Dr. Shainhouse did mention that beauty doesn\u2019t always mean pain, a bit of tingling can actually be a happy indicator that your skin is responding well. In fact, if you check the labels for some of your face masks or topical creams, then you\u2019ll see a warning about those subtly-stinging side effects. \u201cTingling means that it is working when that is the goal. For instance, acid and chemical skin peels do sting, and the expected result is immediate inflammation and then, skin peeling. Topical retinoids are meant to create mild inflammation in the skin and exfoliate skin and encourage new collagen growth,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse explains. \u201cHowever, there is a fine balance, and, generally speaking, skin care and beauty products should not cause irritation and stinging. Irritation in the skin can break down collagen and actually accelerate skin aging.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>5. Know when to call it quits.</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the areas on your face where you\u2019re putting your new skin care regimen. If any of those spots, from your eyes to your cheeks, start to feel uncomfortable and out of whack, it\u2019s time to pack up shop and speak with your dermatologist. \u00a0\u201cIf you have an allergic reaction, such as eyelid, lip swelling or hives, stop using it. If a product tends to make you sun-sensitive, take a break and stop using it before and during sunny vacations, when you might be more prone to sunburn,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says. \u201cIf the redness, burning, swelling persists or occurs each time you use a product, stop using it. See your dermatologist to determine if you\u2019re allergic to one of the ingredients. If your adverse skin reaction doesn\u2019t improve a few days after discontinuing the product and you can\u2019t manage it with over-the-counter skin-calming options, see your dermatologist.\u201d</span></p>"},

But it turns out that applying them in any random order is not doing your face any favors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had questions about the right way to apply products, so we spoke to New York-based dermatologist Dr. Margarita Lolis of the Skin Laser &amp; Surgery Specialists. What she shared can help you master your regimen and get on the right path to the complexion you\u2019re after.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether it\u2019s in the morning or at night, the first step to any good skin care routine is washing your face with a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cleansers+and+Exfoliators_503724.htm\">cleanser</a> that\u2019s right for your skin type or concern. Fortunately for us, there are <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/different-types-of-cleansers/\">many types of face cleansers</a> to choose from: gel, foam, cream, oil, clay, powder, bar and even cleansing waters. \u201cYou can do an exfoliating cleanser if you have blackheads or whiteheads,\u201d says Dr. Lolis. \u201cIf you have sensitive skin, go for cleansers with calming ingredients. Cleansers are not supposed to be one-size-fits-all.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Toners+and+Mists_300083.htm\">toners</a> were initially marketed to remove any leftover traces of makeup or cleanser and tighten the skin, the latest toners do much more than that.\u00a0Depending on the active ingredient, toners can serve several purposes, from hydrating and calming sensitive skin to acting as a delivery system for antioxidants and other nutrients.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people find toner particularly useful, especially if they\u2019re dealing with excess oil. However, Dr. Lolis warned that some toners can dry out the skin and have the opposite effect. \u201cYour skin can get into a feedback mechanism,\u201d she says. \u201cYour skin may end up producing more oil.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your face is dry or easily irritated, go for hydrating or calming mists instead, or skip the toner altogether.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/glow/scc_landing.php?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dsblog_glow&amp;utm_content=howtolayer_small\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24986\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/031317-Blog-Glow-700x70-2.jpg\" alt=\"What Is Glow by Dermstore | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"70\"></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the time to apply any <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Treatments+and+Serums_500918.htm\">treatment creams or serums</a> you want to use. As some treatment products can be drying, it\u2019s best to apply them before your moisturizer. Besides, saving your moisturizer, which is usually thicker and heavier than your serums and spot treatments, for last ensures your treatments are able to penetrate your skin better.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What you apply depends on your individual needs and preference. If you\u2019re dealing with fine lines and wrinkles, your treatment product may include retinol, peptides, antioxidants and growth factors. For hyperpigmentation, reach for serums with brightening ingredients like kojic acid, licorice, vitamin C and alpha hydroxy acids (glycolic, lactic and mandelic acids). For acne, benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid will be your skin care staples. And for dryness and dehydration, something with hyaluronic acid, plant and nut oils and tissue-repairing vitamins should do the trick.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another serum you need to invest in according to Dr. Lolis: An antioxidant serum. \u201cIt repairs the damage that happens in the skin on a daily basis from the inside out. Use it in the morning because the sun and other factors cause wear and tear on the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Moisturizers_300082.htm\">Moisturizer</a> is perhaps the most important step in anyone\u2019s skin care routine, so don\u2019t skip it even if you have oily skin. Instead, reach for lightweight gels or products that are non-comedogenic (doesn\u2019t clog pores). On the other hand, if you tend to have dry skin, look for oil-based, nutrient-rich creams or lotions that not only lock in moisture but also help repair your skin barrier.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from finding the right moisturizer for your skin type, Dr. Lolis also suggests applying your moisturizer the right way. \u201cUse lukewarm water when you wash your face,\u201d Dr. Lolis explains. \u201cApply your moisturizer while your skin is still damp so it penetrates more effectively.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">Sunscreen</a> is a must, no matter the weather. According to the<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/stats/prevention-and-care/sunscreen-faqs\" target=\"_blank\"> American Academy of Dermatology</a>, up to 80 percent of the sun\u2019s UV rays can penetrate your skin on cloudy days, and snow can reflect the sun\u2019s rays onto your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The order in which you apply sunscreen generally depends on your sunscreen formula. Chemical sunscreens work by absorbing the sun\u2019s rays, which means the closest it is to your skin, the better. \u201cSunscreen should come on first, so it penetrates better,\u201d Dr. Lolis said. \u201cWhen you put on other cream first, it creates a barrier between the sunscreen and the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, physical sunscreens work by sitting on top of your skin and forming a physical shield to protect your skin against the sun\u2019s rays. Most experts recommend applying physical sunscreen as the last step in your skin care routine. As some moisturizers have ingredients that can dilute your sunscreen\u2019s formula, make sure that you wait a few minutes in between application.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/glow/scc_landing.php?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=dsblog_glow&amp;utm_content=howtolayer_big\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-24987\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/031317-Blog-Glow-700x300.jpg\" alt=\"What Is Glow by Dermstore | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\"></a></p>"},

Sunscreen is not a one-size-fits-all, and there are so many kinds of sunscreen out there because different people may have different sunscreen needs. Some people may just need it for everyday wear, while others are looking for water-resistant or sweat-proof protection. Your skin type may also help to determine the best option.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s how to ensure you<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Body+Sun+Care_500226.htm\"> find your next favorite sunscree</a>n so you can get a safer dose of the sun.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both UVA and UVB rays can lead to skin cancer, plus UVA rays cause wrinkles and speed up signs of aging, and UVB rays cause sunburns. <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/stats/prevention-and-care/sunscreen-faqs\">The American Academy of Dermatology</a> (AAD) recommends a minimum of SPF 30, which protects against 97% of the sun\u2019s UVB rays. Higher SPFs are better for the fair skinned or those who burn easily, but keep in mind that improvements are minimal\u2014SPF 15 provides 93% protection, so it\u2019s not like 30 is \u201ctwice\u201d as effective. The AAD recommends SPF 50 for the fair skinned or those who burn easily, but don\u2019t insist upon maxing out your SPF. Why? \u201cNo sunscreen can block 100 percent of the sun\u2019s rays,\u201d according to the Academy, and there\u2019s actually no evidence that SPFs higher than 50 protect any better.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A quick look through the ingredients list can help ensure you have the quality and coverage you need. You\u2019ll want to ensure you have both UVA and UVB protection, so look for the term\u00a0\u201cbroad spectrum\u201d in the label.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-Are-The-Differences-Between-Chemical-and-Natural-Sunscreen%3F_2013.htm\">Mineral (or physical) sunscreen</a>\u00a0works by using\u00a0natural minerals zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to reflect the sun\u2019s rays from your skin. On the other hand, chemical sunscreens use chemical compounds like bemotrizinol, avobenzone and biscotizole\u2014all of which\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543289/\" target=\"_blank\">provide broad-spectrum protection</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You may also want to avoid certain\u00a0ingredients like oxybenzone, which, according to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/sunscreen/report/the-trouble-with-sunscreen-chemicals/\" target=\"_blank\">Environmental Working Group (EWG)</a>, can cause allergic skin reactions and may disrupt hormones. The <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-Are-The-Differences-Between-Chemical-and-Natural-Sunscreen%3F_2013.htm\">preservative methylisothiazolinone</a> can also cause issues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many sunscreens are made to specifically help those with dry, oily or sensitive skin. Board-certified dermatologist and skin-cancer surgeon <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-sunscreen-that-youll-actually-wear/\">Michael Shapiro has shared with us</a> that people with dry skin should look for ingredients like glycerin, lanolin, oils, silicones (like dimethicone) and aloe, and avoid sunscreen sprays or gels with alcohol.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For oily skin, lightweight or gel lotions with ingredients like silica or isododecane are best.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For sensitive skin, hypoallergenic and fragrance-free are good bets, as are mineral sunscreens with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide. Alcohols and preservatives should also be avoided.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People with rosacea or acne may need to take alcohol\u2014a common sunscreen ingredient\u2014into consideration, especially when using\u00a0other skin treatments. The <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/sunscreen/choosing\" target=\"_blank\">Skin Cancer Foundation recommends</a> that people who have rosacea or are prone to allergies should avoid sunscreens with alcohol, but that \u201cpatients with acne, however, may find gel formulas, which usually contain alcohol, less likely to aggravate acne.\u201d These can work better for acne-prone people than greasy, cream-based sunscreens. Another anti-acne tip? \u201cThe UVB filter ensulizole has a lighter, less oily consistency than most other chemical sunscreens,\u201d according to the Foundation. Finally, though, be sure to listen to your skin. For example, if you\u2019re using an acne medication cream or treatment, a light cream can help balance out the drying effects of the acne medication.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0You won\u2019t be able to get all the protection your sunscreen can offer if you don\u2019t apply enough, or re-apply at the right time. Sunscreen should be applied every two hours, at minimum, and <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/spot-skin-cancer/learn-about-skin-cancer/prevent/how-to-apply-sunscreen\">AAD</a> tell us, most people need to apply \u201cat least one ounce of sunscreen, about the amount you can hold in your palm,\u201d to get enough coverage. Sunscreen expires after two to three years, so when buying, try to plan out\u00a0how much you might use. If you spend a lot of time outside, you might need to buy a larger supply.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A great way to stick to a healthy sunscreen habit is to build it into your morning routine. There are plenty of foundations with SPF, but according to <a href=\"http://kimjbeauty.com/\">makeup artist Kim Jundt</a>, \u201cjust using foundation as your daily SPF would be a mistake.\u201d She suggests always applying sunscreen under your makeup\u2014either with a protective moisturizer or after your moisturizer. Her technique: \u201cI apply a thin coat of sunscreen, about a quarter size for the face, neck, and don\u2019t forget the ears. Let the sunscreen soak in and use a tissue for any leftover residue. Before applying any makeup, wash the sunscreen off your hands.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What about reapplying sunscreen later in the day, over makeup? Jundt says, \u201cMost ideally you would wash your face and start over but most of us don\u2019t have time for that.\u201d Instead, she says, you can use a makeup setting spray with SPF and \u201cspray throughout the day as it resets makeup while adding SPF.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Choose a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-sunscreen-that-youll-actually-wear/\">sunscreen that you like to wear</a>, because it increases your chances of actually using it to protect your skin. Having a sunscreen that checks all the boxes but is unpleasant to wear isn\u2019t worth it. Some sunscreens may have some nice perks (like shimmer, tint or fruit extracts) that could make you excited about reapplying. Sometimes, that might make all the difference.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No sunscreen protects you from 100% of the sun\u2019s rays, so it\u2019s important to plan your clothing, hats and other barriers carefully. As the <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/prevention/sun-protection/clothing/protection\" target=\"_blank\">Skin Cancer Foundation suggests</a>, \u201cmore is more.\u201d More clothing coverage means more protection from the sun\u2019s rays. The material of the clothing is important, too. Woven fabrics still contain tiny holes between the threads. The Foundation advises that \u201csynthetic fibers such as polyester, lycra, nylon, and acrylic are more protective than bleached cottons, and shiny or lustrous semi-synthetic fabrics like rayon reflect more UV than do matte ones, such as linen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember, that the sun may feel great on your skin when you first go out, but carries risks beyond the occasional sunburn. Stay protected, and you\u2019ll thank yourself later!</p>"},

You also know how to mix and match the contents of your wardrobe, and what shoes go with everything you own. But when you consider the topical creams, moisturizers, serums and under-eye concoctions you put on your skin each and every day, do you ever pause and think about what\u2019s scripted on the back label? You might not give a second thought to the ingredients in your beauty products, but here\u2019s what a lot of women don\u2019t know: not all skin care ingredients, though potent and effective on their own, work well together, and using them at the same time could be putting your skin on a never-ending loop of reaction, solution and repeat. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou want ingredients that will mix and not separate like oil and water in order to get an even distribution of the mixture on your skin. Mixing ingredients can provide additive effects to your skin,\u201d explains </span><a href=\"https://www.looknatural.com/deborah-yu-md/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Deborah Yu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a cosmetic surgeon with The Plastic Surgery Center. \u201cIf ingredients do not necessarily \u2018match,\u2019 you should be aware that you could have a less than optimal result.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what skin care ingredients are soul mates and which ones should call it quits? Here\u2019s what the experts say:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dermatologist </span><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TsipporaShainhouseMD\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tsippora Shainhouse MD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, FAAD says that because both vitamin C and E are antioxidants, their components create an ideal cocktail that can help replenish and repair your skin cells, especially as your skin begins to get older and less firm. Dr. Yu adds: \u201cVitamin C </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">performs a variety of functions within the skin: stimulation of collagen, reducing fine lines and wrinkles and aids in protecting the skin from environmental pollutants. Thus providing enhanced UV protection from UV exposure. And vitamin E steps in to help block free radicals from attacking the skin, reducing the signs of aging.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have acne-prone skin, even into adulthood, you might have trouble identifying what will actually\u00a0get rid of those blemishes before a big board meeting or a promising first date. Dr. Shainhouse says to use a mix of glycolic acid, salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide to get the job done. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acids exfoliate the skin, enabling the benzoyl peroxide to penetrate deeper for improved anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effect,\u201d she explains. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the time you reach your late 20s (and possibly before if you\u2019re really ahead of the skincare game), you\u2019ve probably considered adding a retinoid into your regimen. \u201cThis is a derivative that unclogs pores, exfoliates, and boosts collagen to reduce fine lines, speed cell turnover, even out discoloration and smooth skin. Results can be seen sometimes as little as four weeks,\u201d Dr. Yu says. But as your skin begins to respond to the treatment and shed its first layer, you might notice that your skin is super-sensitive or especially dry. That\u2019s why Dr. Shainhouse says to add a product with hyaluronic acid to balance your system. \u201cThe hyaluronic is hydrating and can help prevent irritation from the retinoid, while allowing it to penetrate and still be effective,\u201d she notes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering what goal you have for the products you\u2019re using, consider their purposes. If you\u2019re using two products that could <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-Skincare-Ingredients-to-Avoid-With-Acne_1925.htm\">potentially dry out your skin</a>, then you\u2019re putting your face through the ringer with double the intensity. \u201cYou do not want to use two potent ingredients that have the same effect on your skin. For example, retinol\u00a0and salicylic acid can each cause skin irritation when used on its own,\u201d Dr. Yu says. \u201cCombining these items might make your skin feel dry and sensitive, especially to light.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need both of these ingredients? One way to work both into your routine is to use them one at a time. In this case, use your salicylic acid-based spot or acne treatment in the morning and then your anti-aging retinol cream at night.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another argument to why you should study up on the label before adopting a new regimen? You could actually cause one product to cancel out the other, thus not solving for any of your irritations, issues or desires. Such is the case with this unhappy couple: \u201cThey have not typically been used together because benzoyl peroxide may reduce the effectiveness of tretinoin. Although one study reports there was no benzoyl peroxide-induced degradation of tretinoin when using the specific concentrations of 0.05 percent tretinoin gel and 6.26 percent benzoyl peroxide gel,\u201d Dr. Yu says. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n            <script>\n            $(document).ready(function () {\n                $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n            });\n            </script>\n        </p>"},

What are some things that pop into your mind? Maybe it\u2019s your first crush or that one weekend your parents let you stay out a whole hour past curfew. While many look back fondly on the overall experience, one thing that nearly everyone can relate to is the emergence of acne. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hormones-acne-aging/\">Natural hormonal shifts</a> in the body make the skin oilier, which leads to clogged pores. Only so many options could curb acne\u2019s impact at the time, but it usually gets better with age.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, many adults still deal with blackhead acne (<a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000873.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">also known as open comedones</a>). Whenever follicles on the skin become clogged by excess oil, dirt or other impurities, the formed blockage becomes visible as a blackhead or whitehead.

These agents may result in a phytophotodermatitis\u2014the sudden appearance of brown streaks or spots without any warning\u2014in the area of contact with no preceding redness or blisters, just like when lemon or lime juice touches your skin and is then exposed to sunlight,\u201d she explains. \u201cAny citrus oil can elicit a similar phytophotodermatitis after exposure to sunlight. They should be avoided, particularly in products intended for daytime use, since you could have this unfortunate experience and develop unsightly brown pigment in the pattern of the contact. The reactions may not be as dramatic as seen with lime, but they are best avoided, as they offer little tangible benefit even in a night cream.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to get the antioxidant properties, Dr. Laughlin says there are plenty of other options. \u201cI prefer to stay with agents like curcumin, resveratrol, green tea extracts and other tea polyphenols, pomegranate extracts and genestein from soya beans. These are all-natural antioxidants with proven benefits that may be used in topical products and little in the way of any known adverse effects,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Journee+Biorestorative+Day+Cream+Broad+Spectrum+Sunscreen+SPF+30_12121.htm\">NeoCutis Journee Bio-restorative Day Cream Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30\u00a0</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some compounds found in rose and lavender essential oils\u2014like monoterpene alcohols\u2014have potential antiseptic and antimicrobial benefits. However, both also contain geraniol and are used in fragrance mixes due to their sweet floral odor. \u201cDermatologists do not like fragrance or perfumed products, they are often complex chemicals with irritant or allergic effects,\u201d Dr. Laughlin says. \u201cGeraniol is a contact allergen and it is estimated that 1 to 2% of the population will be sensitized to it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, if you still want to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wrinkles-acne-or-itchy-scalp-theres-a-beauty-oil-for-that/\">incorporate face\u00a0oils into your routine</a>, Dr. Laughlin says the key is to consider carrier oils that are from the fatty component of a plant, like the seeds or the kernels. \u201cCarrier oils and essential oil-infused carrier oils do not contain volatile aromatic compounds like pure essential oils, which is typically why they have minimal odors. They can contain a rich mix of antioxidants and vitamins that can be beneficial for the skin. Carrier oils like sunflower or safflower oil are generally nourishing for the skin but as a polyunsaturated oil they have limited stability. This can affect the shelf life of skin care products containing them. Hibiscus oil is rich in flavonoids called anthocyanins, which are the colorful compounds that give things like berries their nutritional benefits,\u201d Dr. Laughlin says. \u201cWhether a carrier oil or a natural antioxidant is used in a product, I have a simple philosophy I recommend to patients: Simple is better.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Virgin+Cold+Pressed+Rose+Hip+Oil_71802.htm\">The Organic Pharmacy\u00a0Virgin Cold Pressed Rose Hip Oil</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe concern with hydroquinone is that it can overcorrect the skin and whiten the skin more than was desired. If used for too long, it can also cause a blue-brown discoloration,\u201d Dr. Goldenberg explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though it was once trendy to use, Dr. Laughlin adds that now, it appears on the Health Canada Hot List of prohibited ingredients, due to worries of it being a carcinogen. Even so, it\u2019s still in products. \u201cIt is a big seller in developing countries and many tourists from North America bring it home after vacation. It is very \u00a0irritating and can cause sensitive or reactive skin to create excess pigment as a protective mechanism, in other words it can exacerbate the very condition it was intended to treat.\u00a0It can also cause a disorder called ochronosis, where the excessive buildup of hydroquinone by-products in the skin can lead to bluish/grey pigments that can be very disfiguring and hard to treat,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But if you do want to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/9-best-serums-to-try-for-brighter-skin/\">fade dark spots and brighten your complexion</a>, there are other ways to make it possible, with equally potent skin-brightening\u00a0ingredients like glycolic and kojic acids, licorice extract or retinol.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Lytera+Skin+Brightening+Complex_48737.htm\">SkinMedica Lytera Skin Brightening Complex</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though it varies on hair type and how reasonable and responsive your hair is to treatments and formulas, generally speaking, sodium sulfate is going to leave it flat and dry. \u201cIt is a surfactant that does a great job with removing oil and products from hair shafts. However, it can be too strong and can strip away moisture from hair as well. This leaves the hair feeling dry and less silky,\u201d Dr. Goldenberg says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be safe, opt for a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_SulfateFree_502373.htm\">sulfate-free shampoo</a>, or\u00a0look for sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, a milder alternative that has similar effects.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Be+Gentle+Be+Kind+Avocado+Quinoa+CoWash_61009.htm\">Briogeo Be Gentle Be Kind Avocado Plus Quinoa Co-Wash</a></strong></p>"},

It is somewhat ironic that I was diagnosed at 29, just months after my daughter, Willa, was born\u2014and I didn\u2019t want her or other girls (or moms) to repeat my story, which is why we created the company,\u201d she shared. \u201c\u2018Willa\u2019, my daughter\u2019s name, means protector, which I didn\u2019t realize at the time of her birth</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So I guess you could say that Willa and I were destined to create a skin care company committed to helping women of all ages make smarter skin care choices.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In November of 2008, it was a regular skin check that proved life-altering for Liz Toombs, who was just 25 years old at that time. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had no warning signs. I started getting annual checkups at the dermatologist after being encouraged by my mom to do so.\u00a0I have always been fair-skinned with light eyes and light hair, making me prone to sunburns. To add to that,\u00a0I have several moles and had poor tanning practices in my teens and early twenties (not applying sunscreen\u00a0and\u00a0frequent tanning bed use). Mom thought it would be smart for me to have someone keep an eye on my skin for all of those\u00a0reasons,\u201d she explained.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At first\u00a0she didn\u2019t think skin cancer was a big deal and something that could be easily removed, but she quickly learned how wrong she was when she learned about her diagnosis. \u201cI got a HUGE wake-up call when\u00a0I was\u00a0on the table for my surgery. The doctor was so kind as she talked me through\u00a0what to expect after surgery. She let me know\u00a0I would be uninsurable because of this diagnosis, and asked if\u00a0I already had health and life insurance in place (fortunately,\u00a0I did),\u201d she explained. \u201cShe said that if they didn\u2019t get all the cancer in the\u00a0first surgery,\u00a0I would have to come back for another one (luckily, only the one surgery was required).\u00a0I was shocked to learn how skin cancer can grow and spread if not treated early.

Years later,\u00a0I\u00a0have finally learned to love my skin and to treat it well,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish\u00a0I had\u00a0known that my pursuit of being tan would lead me to have 14 <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Best-Treatments-for-Facial-Scars_1985.htm\">scars from\u00a0dermatological\u00a0surgeries</a> over the\u00a0span of eight years.\u00a0I\u2019d\u00a0like to think\u00a0I would have made different choices.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only has this brave, strong woman survived breast cancer once, but she\u2019s battled it three times.

I saw a general physician who told me, \u2018It is nothing, just a mole, see I have one on my neck\u2019 and he showed me his neck,\u201d Cocuzza explained. \u201cWell, of course, I wanted a second opinion. I saw a dermatological surgeon who diagnosed me after a biopsy with invasive cell carcinoma and I had Mohs surgery a week later.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d Then last year, she had two experiences with crusty bumps, one of which was invasive and one non-invasive, and had surgery to remove them all. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What surprised me the most about skin cancer is that it is not just on the surface of the skin, which I always thought it was, it can affect the inside cells and can go very deep and spread to become invasive,\u201d she shared. \u201cBefore getting my first skin cancer, I wish I knew how deep the cancerous cells could go and how wide they could spread and how big of a physical scar can be left behind. It can spread to the tissues, bones, and nearby lymph nodes.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Her greatest advice to others is to read, research and protect yourself. And more importantly, don\u2019t be embarrassed by your pale skin. \u201cJust the other day I was at a daytime party and all the women were sitting out on the deck facing the sun to get sun on their faces and start their summertime tanning. I sat in a shaded area, out of the sun.

It happens when an injury crushes small blood vessels but does not break the skin.\u201d Bruises can be caused by minor injuries, surgeries/non-invasive treatments, playing sports, general clumsiness, etc. The good news is that bruises tend to resolve themselves within about a week to 10 days. More time may be necessary depending on the severity of the bruise. Though most are no big deal, they can still be painful and unsightly. Here\u2019s how to treat and/or cover up a pesky bruise on your body.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To treat a bruise, you\u2019ll want to grab for a cold compress as soon as possible to help alleviate any swelling that occurs. Applying an ice pack for 30-60 minutes is a good rule of thumb, according to the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.skinsight.com/skin-conditions/first-aid/first-aid-bruises?Imiw9cApl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NIH</a>,\u00a0and over-the-counter pain medication can help to relieve the pain. Try reaching for acetaminophen and avoid pain relievers such as ibuprofen or aspirin, as they slow the clotting of blood and may increase bleeding.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the healing process, you shouldn\u2019t have to let a bruise prevent you from wearing what you want to wear.

After you\u2019ve had a few too many cocktails at happy hour, it takes more than a splash of coconut water and a cup of coffee to get you through that 9 a.m. meeting the next day. Or, after trying the new hot yoga class in your town that everyone is Instagram-ing about, you\u2019re suddenly sore in unfamiliar places.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With age comes wisdom, but also responsibility for our health and longevity. But being mindful extends far beyond taking vitamins, maintaining a healthy weight and getting a good night\u2019s rest. This encompasses our skin, too. While your dermatologist has already reminded you to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/sunscreen-myths-debunked/\">develop a daily sunscreen habit</a>, they might also recommend other anti-aging superstars, like <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/10-wrinkle-serums-that-actually-work/\">wrinkle serums</a>, creams, tonics and more. But if you\u2019ve ever found yourself browsing the virtual shelves of your favorite beauty website, then you know it can be confusing to navigate your way through the myriad of anti-aging products and find the right match for what your skin needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead of opening another tab to continue your search, consider this your guide to all things anti-aging. No more guess work\u2014just results!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Often found in all sorts of containers\u2014from syringes to individual packets and more, face serums are considered <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-are-face-serums/\">one of the most effective anti-aging products</a>\u00a0due to the concentration of their active ingredients. Sometimes referred to as a \u201cbooster,\u201d serums target a specific skin concern. Dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.livadskincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Janet Prystowsky</a> explains, \u201cThe concentrations in serums are meant to penetrate the skin faster and easier than creams because they\u2019re not diluted with moisturizer.\u201d As an example, serums with ingredients like <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a>\u00a0work to remove a layer of your skin, unveiling a smoother, more youthful appearance after just a few weeks\u2019 use. \u201cUsing a brightening serum as a spot treatment for brown spots may work better than using a brightening moisturizer on your whole face,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to use</strong>:\u00a0Dermatologist Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse, M.D., FAAD says that a serum should always come before anything else in your skin care routine. Once you apply this, it\u2019s essential to allow it to completely seep into your pores before adding anything else on top. Dr. Prystowsky notes that after this step, apply a moisturizer to lock in the active ingredients found in the serum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to start using:\u00a0</strong>Though it\u2019s best to chat with your own dermatologist who knows your skin best, dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joshua Zeichner, M.D.</a> explains that cell turnover begins to slow down and your antioxidant defenses decrease when you hit your 30s. During this time, you should opt for a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">serum that has vitamin C</a> and vitamin E, on a daily basis. \u201cThey are like fire extinguishers and put out inflammation caused by UV-induced free radicals,\u201d he says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Vitamin+C++E+Complex_2708.htm\">SkinMedica Vitamin C + E Complex</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cCream\u201d is a catch-all term for all sorts of products\u2014from your typical moisturizer to day and night\u00a0creams to an Americanized version of \u201ccr\u00e8me.\u201d Most of these more lotion-like varieties offer a mix of hydration, nutrients and sun protection. As Dr. Prystowsky explains, \u201cAnti-aging creams are moisturizers with key ingredients that smooth fine lines and wrinkles. Some anti-aging creams are meant to brighten skin as well.\u201d Unlike a serum that could potentially dry out or over-exfoliate your skin, depending on the ingredients, a cream is more gentle and can be applied both morning and night.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another quality of creams that\u2019s beneficial for your skin regardless of age is the SPF protection that\u2019s often included as part of the formula. More than any other anti-aging tactic you try, keeping your pores shielded from sunshine is more impactful in the long run.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to use</strong>: Be mindful of finding <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-moisturizers-dry-oily-sensitive-skin/\">an anti-aging cream or moisturizer that is compatible with your skin type</a>. You should double-check that you\u2019re not adding extra oil if you\u2019re acne prone. Also, avoid products that include a drying agent if you already struggle with dehydrated skin. Speak with your dermatologist if you have trouble finding the right variety.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to start using</strong>: Now! As Dr. Shainhouse says, moisturizer with sunscreen should be part of your regimen, no matter how old you are. The earlier you start, the better your results will be.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Tomato+Day+Cream+SPF+16_8546.htm\">Eminence Organics Tomato Day Cream SPF 16 </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever glance at yourself in the airplane mirror while on a red-eye? You probably had to do a double-take to recognize yourself, with those dark saggy bags hanging dangerously close to your cheekbones. Though the level of pigmentation will vary depending on your ethnicity and genetics (thanks, Mom!), the skin around our eyes is among the first to show signs of aging. This is the reason\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-use-an-eye-cream/\">most dermatologists recommend using a specialized cream for your eyes</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe skin surrounding the eye area of your face is a little thinner and more delicate than the rest of the face,\u201d Dr. Prystowsky notes. But as far as the formulas in an anti-aging cream and an under-eye cream? She explains that the biggest difference isn\u2019t really in the ingredients, but in the concentration. Because you need some more TLC under your eyelashes, you\u2019ll see a higher quantity of active ingredients in under-eye creams. Dr. Zeichner adds that most under-eye creams will be void of fragrances too, which can cause some discomfort in this sensitive area.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to use</strong>: After applying your anti-aging serum, let the first layer dry. Then, add a pea-sized amount, about the size of your pinky-finger tip directly below your eye. Be careful not to get this in your eye, but <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/videos/how-to-apply-eye-cream/\">massage gently and inwardly</a>, so you don\u2019t pull against the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to use</strong>: Though there\u2019s not a bad time to start giving some love to your eyes, Dr. Shainhouse says that when you hit your 30s, this is a good time to start investigating <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-use-an-eye-cream/\">which eye cream\u00a0is best for you</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_ELASTIderm+Eye+Treatment+Cream_9346.htm\">Obagi ELASTIderm Eye Treatment Cream</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019ve probably heard the term \u201cretinoid\u201d thrown around, but you might not know what this trendy word actually means. By definition, a retinoid is a group of compounds derived or chemically related to\u00a0vitamin A, which <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-reasons-retinol-is-your-best-anti-aging-weapon/\">benefits the skin</a> in a lot of ways, Dr. Zeichner notes. You\u2019ll see this ingredient in your products\u2019 labels as retinol, retinal or retinoic acid, all of which\u00a0are designed to neutralize free radicals and exfoliate the first layer of your skin, fading fine lines, wrinkles, acne marks and other blemishes. You\u2019ll find retinoid as a star ingredient in many anti-aging serums and creams in lower concentrations, but <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">prescription-strength retinoid\u00a0creams and serums</a>\u00a0will have at least .5 to 1%.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to use</strong>: Because this product can cause your skin to dry out and sometimes turn red, it\u2019s best to talk to your dermatologist before starting a retinoid regimen, Dr. Zeichner explains. You can usually pair your retinoid product with a moisturizer, but you\u2019ll want to make sure they\u2019re compatible, too. For a more detailed instruction, here\u2019s\u00a0a video on\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/video-how-to-apply-retinol-for-the-best-results/\">how to apply retinol</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to use</strong>: When you\u2019re about to hit that big 4-0, consider yourself welcome to the retinoid family. \u201cIn your 40s, previous sun exposure leads to collagen damage, which weakens the skin\u2019s foundation. Make sure that you are using a topical retinoid in the evening to help stimulate collagen, strengthen the skin and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d Dr. Zeichner says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+10+Maximum+Strength+Refining+Night+Cream_4505.htm\">SkinCeuticals\u00a0Retinol 1.0 Maximum Strength Refining Night Cream</a></strong></p>"},

In fact, in a study coordinated by Allergan, \u201c21% of women who received dermal filler in 2016 did so in their lips.\u201d<sup>1</sup> Dozens of makeup and skin care brands offer </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Lip+Plumper_500126.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lip plumpers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and lip enhancers designed to soften and volumize your pout with just a swipe. There\u2019s also been an increase in the popularity of lip injections and augmentations in recent years.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Read on for everything we\u2019ve learned about how lip plumpers work, tips for getting quick one-off results versus long-term steps you can take, plus some interesting stats from skin care brand SkinMedica, who has developed a new product based on their own studies.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, we had to know: Where did this trend toward fuller lips come from?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While certain social media queens can take some of the credit, <a href=\"http://www.weimag.ch/micha/dc/05_Buss_Strategies%20of%20Human%20Mating.pdf\">the desire for full lips is rooted in psychology</a>. Studies like \u201cStrategies of Human Mating\u201d reveal that humans find females to be most physically attractive when their appearance signifies health, fertility and reproductive value. Essentially, women who look healthy and youthful\u2014with \u201cfull lips, smooth skin and lustrous hair\u201d\u2014are often seen as the most appealing. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Of course, beauty is subjective; not everyone is attracted to full lips, and not everyone wants them. But if full lips will give you the look and confidence you want, here are some of the different ways to get there (arranged from quick fixes to longer-lasting results).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you just want to plump your lips for a day or night, you can instantly create a fuller, more defined look with a makeup trick or two. Here are some of the techniques beauty bloggers swear by: </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to make your lips look fuller without the wait, try using a lip plumper that stimulates blood flow to your lips to temporarily increase their fullness. (These are the ones that tingle a bit.)\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some essential oils have circulation-stimulating properties, creating a temporary plumping effect when used on the lips. Cinnamon, for example, </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4003790/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is said to be effective at increasing blood circulation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014according to a study on cinnamon\u2019s medicinal uses on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) site. Ginger has similar properties. Another study published on the NIH site suggests that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4369959/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ginger triggers a warming sensation</a> to improve blood flow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some people are just born with thinner lips, others may lose some of their fullness over time. SkinMedica, who recently released a new two-step treatment for fuller, healthier lips\u2014the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_HA5+Smooth++Plump+Lip+System_71078.htm\">HA<sup>5</sup> Smooth &amp; Plump Lip System</a>\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">explains how this happens: \u201cSimilar to the skin on your face, lips also lose the capacity to produce collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid over time.\u201d\u00a0</span>Collagen, elastin and hyaluronic acid <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583892/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">all make up your dermis </a>(the layer of skin that contains blood vessels, nerve endings and pores). These components are responsible for giving your skin its firmness, fullness and elasticity. As you stop producing as much of these (which can happen as early as age 16), your lips can become thinner and less defined, while losing some of their color.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your lips are usually affected before the rest of your face, SkinMedica adds, because, \u201cunlike the face, lips do not contain oil glands to help combat the visible signs of aging, making fine lines more apparent and oftentimes appearing dry and cracked when dehydrated.\u201d Because of this, if you want to really make a lasting change in your lips, you need to focus on hydrating and healing above all. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not already familiar with the wonder ingredient known as </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyaluronic acid (HA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s time to get acquainted\u2014as you\u2019re going to be seeing it quite a bit in skin care and beauty products. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HA is a type of sugar found in your connective tissues, joints, skin and just about every other part of your body. It helps keep your skin supple and firm, as it can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water and has the ability to draw water to the surface of your skin where it may be lacking. Because it\u2019s already found in every part of your body, it\u2019s unlikely to cause an allergic reaction and is generally safe to use. This makes it an ideal compound\u2014not just for plumping, but for giving your lips a more youthful glow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The </span><a href=\"https://d2wirczt3b6wjm.cloudfront.net/News/Statistics/2016/2016-plastic-surgery-statistics-report.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2016 National Plastic Surgery Statistics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> report shows a steady increase in popularity in HA injections (commonly known as Juv\u00e9derm or Restylane) since 2000. In 2016, HA took the number-two spot as one of the most popular minimally invasive procedures. While collagen fillers were once the best option for fuller lips, HA is now the star of the show\u2014as it doesn\u2019t just fill; it actually heals. Plus, while collagen fillers last for 3\u20134 months, </span><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/productsandmedicalprocedures/cosmeticdevices/wrinklefillers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hyaluronic acid fillers can last for up to a year</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, according to the FDA.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Topical treatments powered by hyaluronic acid can be a great way to complement fillers and injections for many people. And for many others who\u2019d rather forego the needles altogether, topical plumpers offer just the right amount of fullness. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kaitlin Willow wears many hats at Dermstore: copywriter, marketing/SEO strategist and community manager.

For those with persistent problems, for whom the solution does not come in an over-the-counter form, a visit to the skin doctor may be the answer. New York-based dermatologist\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://kerisderm.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Sumayah Jamal</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, MD, PhD helps clarify what exactly dermatologists do and what a new patient can expect on their first appointment. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This seems like a simple one, but it should be noted that dermatologists </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doctors. After obtaining their bachelor\u2019s degrees, those seeking a career in dermatology attend medical school, becoming a medical doctor (MD) or a doctor of osteopathic medicine (DO). They subsequently complete a yearlong internship and at least three years in a dermatology residency program.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After receiving one\u2019s license to practice medicine, an individual can become a </span><a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/why-see-a-dermatologist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">board-certified dermatologist</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">by completing board exams, which test a doctor\u2019s knowledge, experience and skills. To maintain board certification, a doctor must retake the exams every ten years. This ensures they stay up to date on industry trends, conditions and treatments.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to treating skin conditions, dermatologists specialize in the treatment of hair, nails and mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, nose and eyelids).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dermatologists are able to diagnose more than\u00a03,000 diseases including some you\u2019ve heard of, such as acne and psoriasis, and some you may not have, like </span><a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1069121-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">argyria</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which causes the skin to be stained a grey-blue shade.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Patients visit skin specialists for a host of medical and cosmetic reasons. </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm?keyword=acne#expand\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is the most common skin condition in the U.S., affecting approximately 85 percent of people between the ages of 12 and 24, according to the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.aad.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)</a>.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0While there are </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dermatologist+Approved_501453.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermatologist-approved skin care products</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can effectively treat acne and other conditions, serious and persistent problems may require consultation with a professional. For Dr. Jamal, acne is a leading impetus for visits to her office, along with rashes. She also frequently performs cosmetic treatments like Botox, laser hair removal or chemical peels. Other common\u00a0concerns include the treatment of age spots and wrinkles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Jamal urges, \u201cAny </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-does-skin-cancer-look-like/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new or changing moles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should be evaluated by a dermatologist.\u201d These could be indicators of skin cancer, which is the most common cancer in the U.S. The AAD\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">finds that <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/stats/conditions/skin-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">almost 10,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with skin cancer every day</a>. It is, therefore, a healthy practice to regularly give oneself a </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/become-a-skin-checker-infographic/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin check at home</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you have family history of a serious skin condition, it is also advisable to visit a dermatologist\u2014even if you don\u2019t suspect anything.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with all medical consultations, you\u2019ll want to be prepared when you first visit a dermatologist. Dr. Jamal suggests, \u201cIf you have several skin concerns, it may be helpful to write a list so you don\u2019t forget what to bring to your doctor\u2019s attention.\u201d Also don\u2019t forget:\u00a0<em>Y</em></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ou</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> need to pay attention too. It\u2019s a good idea to take notes at your appointment to reference once you get home.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In terms of what questions you\u2019ll be expected to answer, Dr. Jamal says, \u201cYour dermatologist will ask questions based upon the specific issues you have.\u201d You\u2019ll want to inform your doctor of any over-the-counter products, medications and treatments you\u2019ve tried in the past, and how you reacted to each one. The doctor will then perform an examination and make treatment recommendations\u2014which may range from lifestyle changes to a medical procedure.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When searching for a dermatologist, there are numerous online resources including </span><a href=\"https://www.zocdoc.com/dermatologists\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ZocDoc</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.healthgrades.com/usearch?what=Dermatology&amp;where=New%20York,%20NY%2010010&amp;pt=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health Grades</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which offer ratings and reviews of doctors. You can search the </span><a href=\"https://www.aad.org/find-a-derm/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Academy of Dermatology</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">website for local skin specialists.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Additionally, many hospitals have dermatology departments with top-rated skin specialists. Another route is traditional word of mouth, to solicit a recommendation from your personal or professional networks. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is important to note that while certain insurance carriers do cover visits to the dermatologist, you may need a referral from your primary care physician\u00a0(PCP). Check with your insurance carrier before booking an appointment with a specialist to see\u00a0if a visit to your PCP will be necessary.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If during your visit to a dermatologist they recommend any treatments or procedures, you\u2019ll want to see if your insurance company will cover the costs. You could check with your carrier beforehand, if you have an idea of what treatment you might need.\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">Another approach would be to go to your appointment and get recommendations. Afterward call your insurance carrier to see if a recommended procedure is\u00a0covered and what the costs would be, then make a follow-up if you want to do it.</span> For example, cosmetic treatments are typically not covered. You\u2019ll likely have to pay out of pocket for something unrelated to health concerns.</p>"},

They add a protective layer to your skin (which helps lock down moisture) and restore its natural lipid barrier, making it easier to absorb other products. And if you\u2019re the type who likes immediate results, you\u2019ll love that beauty oils add an instant softness, silkiness and healthy glow to your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As effective as face\u00a0oils are for nourishing parched skin and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-use-cleansing-oil/\">removing stubborn makeup residue</a>, oils are\u00a0also good for many other things\u2014whether it\u2019s purifying clogged pores, relieving scalp irritations, calming your senses before you sleep, improving the appearance of cellulite, strengthening weak nails or even taming a wild and bushy beard!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to take your beauty oil love to the next level?\u00a0Read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your fear of breakouts is what\u2019s stopping you from hopping on the beauty oils train, then worry no more because this cleansing oil does the exact opposite! Specially formulated for acne-prone and oily skin, it\u2019s infused with skin-clarifying ingredients like charcoal, seawater and grapeseed oil that rid your face of dirt and makeup, refine\u00a0pores and exfoliate your skin to encourage faster cell turnover.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Summer is the perfect time to rock those beachy waves (being on an actual beach is optional). But the heat and humidity can come down hard on your hair, leaving you with an irritated scalp and frizzy locks. This calming hair treatment relieves itchy scalp with its special blend of peppermint, spearmint and tea tree oil that provides a cooling and soothing effect. Infused with Binchotan charcoal and witch hazel, it detoxifies and cleanses while keeping oiliness under control.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Infused with meadowfoam seed oil, tocotrienols and argan oil, this lightweight formula protects your skin from the sun while feeding your skin with skin-softening nutrients.

This body oil, with its potent blend of organic and essential oils, flushes out harsh toxins and rejuvenates your skin. It also improves microcirculation, which makes it ideal in treating areas with cellulite buildup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to your skin, there\u2019s no such thing as too much TLC (considering the exposure it gets to UV rays and environmental stress).

I\u2019d take off my makeup, wash my face, put on some moisturizer and call it a night. (And I hate to admit it, but sometimes I\u2019d go to bed with makeup still on and no cares in the world.) </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether because of all the new products I\u2019m discovering\u00a0or wealth of information I\u2019m surrounded by each day, my routine quickly changed for the better (and became exponentially more complicated). I had heard of serums and face oils and all sorts of treatments before, but I\u2019d never tried them or even really looked into what they were used for. Now, my drawers are overflowing with goodies\u2014and I am in no way complaining.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curious about how my new routine stacked up to others\u2019 around me, I asked some of my coworkers for a glimpse into their nighttime skin care routine.

I use it as an overnight mask when my skin is feeling extra dry\u2014like during the winter or after a day at the beach\u2014and I feel good as new the next morning. Plus, it smells like coconut and brown sugar.

The combination between both helps with my oily T-zone and hydrates any dryness around my chin. I use one to two drops at night\u2014a little goes a long way. It may feel a little oily at first; however, my skin absorbs it amazingly. I usually use any excess on my neck and chest.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Skin Type:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Combination</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Skin Concerns:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hormonal breakouts, blemishes, dryness </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. \u201cI begin my routine by removing my makeup with a cleansing towelette. I noticed that wipes won\u2019t remove 100% of my makeup, so I apply a gentle cleansing solution on a q-tip to go over my eyelids since I wear eyeshadow and liquid liner every day. Next, I use a rich deep cleansing cream and massage it onto my face and leave this on for about 10 minutes\u2014sometimes longer depending on how distracted I get by what\u2019s on TV. Then I wash off the cream with a gentle foaming cleanser and splash my face with lukewarm water at least 15 times.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Balancing+Masque+Duo_62782.htm\"><b>Eminence Organic Skin Care</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Balancing Masque Duo</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I\u2019m having a particularly bad skin week, I\u2019ll try to salvage my skin with a face mask. I really like the Balancing Masque duo from Eminence because it\u2019s specifically formulated for combination skin types. Charcoal really helps to draw out any excess oil and clear my pores, which is what I need since I wear liquid foundation and am totally guilty of wearing my day makeup to the gym.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_AntiAging++Moisturizing+Organic+Sheet+Mask+Box_69985.htm\"><b>ORGAID</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Anti-Aging &amp; Moisturizing Organic Sheet Mask</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf I notice that my skin needs an extra boost in hydration, my go-to product is the Anti-Aging &amp; Moisturizing Organic Sheet Mask by ORGAID. This is by far my FAVORITE sheet mask! My skin literally feels baby soft after just 20 minutes of this on. Plus, unlike other sheet masks, this actually stays on your face so you\u2019re not confined to just lying down on your couch.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4.\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Martian+Mattifying+Melting+WaterGel+Toner_70304.htm\"><strong>Sunday Riley</strong> Martian Mattifying Melting Water-Gel Toner</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI finish off my nightly routine with some\u00a0 Sunday Riley\u2019s Martian Mattifying Melting Water-Gel Toner</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. I use one pump of this gel and gently massage it onto my face, avoiding the eye area. I\u2019ve definitely noticed an improvement in my overall skin tone and texture after using this. Since the toner dries and absorbs quickly, I like to layer this with a rich moisturizer.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5.<b>\u00a0</b><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Hydrating+Day+and+Night+Cream_69771.htm\"><b>TULA Skincare</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Hydrating Day and Night Cream</span></a><strong>**</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPerfect for using all year round, the Hydrating Day and Night Cream by TULA \u00a0deeply hydrates my skin without making it feel greasy. Now that I\u2019m a couple of years away from the big 3-0, I\u2019ve been really diligent about preserving my neck area. In addition to applying this to my face, I\u2019ve been lathering this onto my d\u00e9colletage and my neck has never felt softer! Definitely helps to reduce the appearance of those pesky neck lines too! With the help of this night cream, I wake up to nourished and supple skin every morning.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Lip+Balm++Pryenees+Lavender+with+Cardamom_22213.htm\"><b>Pangea Organics</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Lip Balm</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLast but not least, I NEVER go to bed without applying a lip balm. I battle with chapped and dry lips on a daily basis so I never step out of the house or go to bed without this. My favorite product at the moment is the lavender and cardamom Lip Balm by Pangea Organics. I have really sensitive lips that always break out whenever I try a new product, but this lip balm is gentle and moisturizing on my dry lips.

Even in such a small sample of people, our routines are vastly different.

This is unsurprising, as one thing we hear time and time again is just <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/your-burning-questions-about-moisturizers-answered-by-a-dermatologist/\">how important it is to moisturize and hydrate your skin</a> (yes, even if it\u2019s oily!). And it almost goes without saying that you should be cleansing your face every day to get rid of makeup, dirt, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/effects-of-air-pollution-on-skin/\">pollutants</a> and anything else that could clog your pores or affect your skin\u2019s ability to protect itself.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another noteworthy trend is in the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/todays-hottest-beauty-finds-according-to-dermstores-beauty-buyers/\">brands we\u2019re drawn to</a>. Almost all of us use at least one natural brand\u2014 most likely because these items are clean and made without unnecessary fillers. A few of us take our beauty sleep to another level by\u00a0creating a relaxing atmosphere using <em>This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray</em>.

Don\u2019t fret, because we\u2019re here to help! Here are seven popular facial hair removal methods to consider. See ya later, fuzz.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> Whether you want to shape your brows or show that mustache who\u2019s boss, waxing is an effective (and pretty affordable) hair removal method to consider trying on various parts of your face. You\u2019ll just need to make sure your hair is at least \u00bc of an inch or longer. During a waxing session, a pro will spread either soft or hard wax onto your skin and pull it off when the wax dries to remove hairs at the root, says Holly Green, esthetician and owner of <a href=\"http://www.norabloom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Norabloom Botanicals &amp; Beauty Lounge</a> in Ithaca, New York. Green prefers hard wax for the face since it tends to be thicker, is applied warm, dries on the skin and is removed without a cloth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> Minimal to medium discomfort, but it\u2019s really different for everyone, says Green, adding that sometimes comfortable surroundings can make you feel more at ease, thus lessening the pain. \u201cThe first time is always the worst,\u201d says Green, \u201cbut after that it\u2019s fantastic\u2014knowing what to expect and having a skilled pro really go at it makes it less scary.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> Anywhere from four to six weeks, says Green.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong> Anywhere from $9-25, varies depending on the salon, where you live, and the area of your face you\u2019re waxing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Since hairs are removed at the root, you can typically go at least a month between waxing appointments. Waxing is something that\u2019s best left to the pros, so you may want to skip out if you\u2019re more of an at-home hair removal kind of gal. It can be difficult to gauge the temperature of the wax at home, so you could burn yourself. The good news is that a pro facial waxing is pretty affordable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts: </strong>After getting waxed, the first step you should take is applying sunscreen. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that when you wax, you\u2019re pulling the top layer of skin off,\u201d comments Green. \u201cYou can get hyperpigmentation if you don\u2019t protect yourself from the sun\u2014especially on your upper lip.\u201d Oh yeah\u2014and save the spa treatment for another day. \u201cIt\u2019s not ideal to come in and get a wax and then get a facial,\u201d says Green, as this can cause unnecessary irritation to vulnerable skin. If you experience any redness afterwards, apply a cool compress, suggests Green. Experiencing ingrown hairs? Roll on some <a href=\"http://dermstore.com/product_PFB+Vanish_21832.htm\">PFB Vanish</a> gel, which has willow bark extract and camphor oil to curb inflammation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> The name pretty much describes what\u2019s going on\u2014a hair removal specialist uses a thread to pull rows of hair out from the root, says Santi Garay, lead brow specialist at <a href=\"http://www.browhaus.com/us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Browhaus</a> in New York City. While brows are the most popular area to have threaded, you can get it done just about anywhere on your face, including your forehead, sideburns, cheeks and upper lip. A full eyebrow threading will typically take 15 to 20 minutes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> \u201cOn a scale of one to 10, the first visit might be close to a seven, but the more you do it, the less it will hurt in the future,\u201d says Garay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> About four to six weeks, says Garay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong> Anywhere from $5-$30, depending on the salon, where you live and the area of your face you\u2019re threading.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Like waxing, you can expect to go quite a while before needing a touch-up. Unlike waxing, however, threading doesn\u2019t remove the top layer of skin so this could be a better option if you\u2019re sensitive, use a lot of retinol products or take meds that thin your skin, says Lindsey Blondin, lead esthetician at <a href=\"http://www.georgethesalon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">George the Salon</a> in Chicago. \u201cThreading would also be a good option for older women who have thin skin,\u201d comments Blondin. That being said, threading usually takes longer than waxing, so don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be in and out of the salon chair in five minutes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts:</strong> \u201cCome in with full brows,\u201d says Garay. \u201cDon\u2019t shave yourself beforehand because it\u2019ll be harder to shape them.\u201d If you experience any post-threading discomfort, apply a cooling cream, recommends Garay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> Dermaplaning is actually an anti-aging treatment with the added benefit of removing facial hair. It involves the use of a flat razor that looks like a scalpel to scrape off the top layer of skin. \u201cIt helps turn over skin cell buildup and helps with hyperpigmentation,\u201d says Blondin. Dermaplaning removes vellus hairs (a.k.a. peach fuzz) on the surface of your skin\u2014it doesn\u2019t remove hair at the root. It\u2019s super-trendy these days as it leaves skin feeling super smooth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> Minimal\u2014it feels like a light feather. \u201cIt\u2019s really gentle,\u201d says Blondin. \u201cEvery now and then you might feel it catch on a hair or a heavier piece of skin, but it\u2019s not painful.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> About three to four weeks, however you may be able to go as long as six to eight weeks in between sessions, says Blondin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong> Prices typically start at $100 for a professional treatment, depending on the salon and where you live, although you can also invest in a professional at-home device. If you decide to DIY it, you\u2019ll have to restock on blades.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Since dermaplaning doesn\u2019t remove hair at the root, it may not be the best facial hair removal option for those with coarse hair, says Blondin. That being said, there is a bright side to this. \u201cWhen you dermaplane, the follicle is still there right at the surface, which protects the skin,\u201d says Blondin. One of the cool things about dermaplaning is that you can do it at home. The <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Dermaflash+Facial+Exfoliating+Device_69319.htm\">DERMAFLASH Facial Exfoliating Device</a> has a stainless steel edge that <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-dermaflash/\">removes dead skin cells and fine hairs</a> from your cheeks, jawline, upper lip, chin and forehead. Plus, it comes with six blades. Also, at-home tools have guards on them so you can\u2019t cut yourself, but this also means you won\u2019t get quite as close to the skin, says Blondin. Professional treatments and at-home tools are on the pricier side, so if you\u2019re just looking to remove a few strays and aren\u2019t really interested in the anti-aging benefits of dermaplaning, you may want to think about picking a more budget-friendly hair removal option.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts:</strong> \u201cAny time you\u2019re exfoliating, you should be very mindful of being in the sun,\u201d says Blondin. After dermaplaning, slather on an SPF and skip the retinol products for a couple of days, as these can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. If you\u2019re planning on waxing, do so the day before\u2014not immediately before\u2014since your skin will be really sensitive afterwards. \u201cIf you go over the area that\u2019s been waxed, it can become agitated and irritated,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> With this close-to-permanent facial hair removal method, a laser is used to target your hair\u2019s pigment, singeing the hair, damaging it and killing it off, says Jennifer Nemeth, a laser specialist and co-founder of <a href=\"http://www.flashlablaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Flash Lab</a> in New York City. Laser hair removal is commonly used to target hair on the upper lip and chin, says Nemeth. You\u2019ll need at least six treatments, but usually more on your face as hair growth there is often hormonal. At the end of your sessions, you can expect an 85 to 95 percent reduction in hair, says Nemeth. On the plus side, when hairs do grow in, it\u2019ll be finer. Nemeth adds that women with PCOS (a hormonal condition that causes excessive facial and body hair growth) often opt for laser hair removal as a way to help manage this symptom.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> It feels like a rubber band snap and some people may experience slight pinching or a little heat, says Nemeth. \u201cThe pain is negligible, as there are various cooling methods, like blowing cold air or spritzing a cool blast of water that can be used during the treatment,\u201d says Christian Kavalos, laser hair removal expert and owner of <a href=\"https://www.romeojuliettelaserhairremoval.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Romeo &amp; Juliette Laser Hair Removal Spa</a> in New York City.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> If done properly, the results could be permanent, says Kavalos. But since facial hair growth has to do with your hormones, any changes could affect regrowth or new growth, says Kavalos.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average</strong>: Anywhere from $75 for your chin or upper lip to $350 for a full face, per session. If you want to do it yourself at home, there is a one-time cost to buying at-home devices like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Mini_66331.htm\">LumaRx Mini</a>,\u00a0which costs $379.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> A laser hair removal session is quick, ringing in at just about five minutes, says Nemeth. However, you\u2019ll generally need six to eight sessions spaced five to six weeks apart, says Kavalos. Also, it\u2019s expensive, so this requires time and a financial investment. Of course, the biggest perk is that laser hair removal is quite long-lasting.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts:</strong> \u201cMake sure you go to a technician who has a license,\u201d says Nemeth. If you have darker skin, you should also make sure that your technician has lasers that work on your skin tone, says Kavalos. That\u2019s because there needs to be a contrast between your skin tone and the color of your hair. Nemeth explains that lasers with longer wavelengths work on darker skin tones. Since there needs to be that contrast, don\u2019t use self-tanner for a few weeks before a laser treatment, says Kavalos. You should also avoid tweezing or waxing for at least a month beforehand, since you need to maintain your roots in order for the laser to destroy them, says Nemeth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> This hair removal method has been around for centuries and for good reason. Sugaring involves applying a natural paste to the skin and gently extracting hair in the natural direction of growth, says Lina Kennedy, CEO and president of <a href=\"http://www.alexandriaprofessional.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alexandria Professional</a>, a leading provider of body sugaring products. Sugaring is different than waxing in that the sugar paste won\u2019t remove that top layer of skin, so it\u2019s a gentler alternative if you tend to get sensitive. The paste is also able to grab hair at the beginning stage of growth, so you don\u2019t have to wait until your hair is \u00bc-inch or longer for removal, says Kennedy. Sugaring is done by hand\u2014the paste is applied by an esthetician and removed using a flicking motion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> Minimal\u2014since sugaring isn\u2019t removing that top layer of skin, it should hurt less than waxing, says Kennedy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> Sugaring typically lasts a month or two longer than traditional waxing, says Kennedy.\u00a0 That\u2019s because the sugar paste grabs hairs at the root, while waxing may just break the hairs at the surface, meaning they\u2019ll grow back faster.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong> Roughly $15-$60, depending on the salon, where you live and the area of your face you\u2019re sugaring.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Sugaring is a natural alternative to waxing and since it removes follicles directly from the root (but doesn\u2019t remove skin), those with sensitive skin may experience less irritation. That being said, it may cost more money than traditional waxing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts:</strong> \u201cFor any form of hair removal, you want to stay away from the sun afterwards,\u201d says Kennedy. Since sugaring exfoliates and opens up the skin, Kennedy is a proponent of being careful with what sunscreen you use. You may want to look for a natural option to prevent chemicals from being absorbed into your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> Chances are you\u2019ve plucked eyebrow hairs, nose hairs or chin hairs at some point in your life. This hair removal method is simple. You\u2019re removing individual hairs by pulling them out one at a time with a pair of tweezers. Most of the time, tweezing will be used as a supplement to another hair removal method to get rid of ingrown or really short hairs, says Garay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor: </strong>There might be a little bit of pain the first time, but the more you tweeze your brows, the less painful it will become. Also, plucking from the base and in the direction of your hair growth will also help any further discomfort.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> Like waxing and threading, results last about four to six weeks since you\u2019re pulling hair out at the root, says Garay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong> Free when you\u2019re doing it at home\u2014otherwise you\u2019re likely to find it included in with waxing or threading. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/list_checkbox.php?search&amp;lkey=tweezer&amp;keyword=tweezer\">Tweezer</a> cost ranges from $10 to $25.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Tweezing isn\u2019t really that efficient of a facial hair removal option on its own, since hairs are removed individually, says Garay. It\u2019s great for maintenance, though.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts:</strong> If you decide to tweeze any facial hairs on your eyebrows or elsewhere, Garay recommends showering and exfoliating first to open up your pores. Also, only tweeze hairs that fall outside the shape of your brows, says Garay. Don\u2019t use a pair of tweezers to shape your brows, as you may end up over-plucking.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The process:</strong> This is basically the most well-known hair removal method and the one you can most easily DIY at home. All you need is a razor, some shaving cream and you\u2019re good to go. Blondin says that like dermaplaning, you\u2019ll get a gentle exfoliation effect when you shave your face, but you won\u2019t get nearly as close to the skin. The <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/skin-hair-nails/skin-care/how-to-shave\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Academy of Dermatology (AAD)</a> advises using a razor with a sharp blade and lightly gliding it over your skin to prevent cuts. If you want to try the electric kind, the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Womens+Electric+Shaver_66334.htm\">LumaRx Women\u2019s Electric Shaver</a> has a four-blade system and forms to the contours of your face for a close, gentle shave.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ouch factor:</strong> Minimal\u2014just make sure you lather up with a shaving oil, gel or cream to ward off nicks and bumps.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How long the results last:</strong> As little as a day, according to the AAD.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How much it costs, on average:</strong>\u00a0Typical disposable razors start at $5, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Womens+Electric+Shaver_66334.htm\">electric shavers</a> at $50. Shaving creams and oils can range from $5 to $30.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pros and cons:</strong> Shaving your facial hair is definitely convenient. After all, you don\u2019t need to leave your bathroom to do it! But if you break out on the regular, take note: The AAD states that irritation caused by shaving can actually make acne worse. And keep in mind that this is something you may need to do every single day, since you won\u2019t be able to remove hair nearly as effectively with a razor as you would if you got a professional facial hair removal treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dos and don\u2019ts: </strong>Do not shave your face when it\u2019s dry. Always wet your skin and hair first, as this will soften things up and make the process easier. Don\u2019t skip out on using shaving cream, either. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Pearl+Polish+Dual+Action+Body+Oil_67534.htm\">Shaveworks Pearl Polish Dual Action Body Oil</a>, which is full of moisturizing ingredients like jojoba oil, argan oil, grapeseed and vitamin E works as both a body wash and shaving oil. Make sure to use your razor in the direction your hair grows as well as pop in a new blade (or switch to a new disposable razor) after five to seven shaves to avoid post-shaving redness.</p>"},

Plus 5 More FAQs</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Alex Barczak \u00b7 June 8, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-27858\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/main-woman-drinking-water-after-workout.jpg\" alt=\"woman drinking water after \" width=\"750\" height=\"620\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let\u2019s talk about sweat, baby. For the most part, sweat is a perfectly natural part of human existence. However, there are a surprising amount of misconceptions about sweat and how it affects the body (whether or not it\u2019s good for your skin, in particular).\u00a0Let\u2019s dive into the function of sweat, determine how it affects your skin health\u00a0and when sweating could indicate a bigger issue.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sweat (also known as perspiration) is the body\u2019s inherent way of cooling itself down when it gets too hot. The overheating can be caused by a number of things\u00a0including <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003218.htm\" target=\"_blank\">exercise, hot weather or stressful situations</a>. When overheating occurs, the nervous system triggers a process that releases sweat through glands on the body. The liquid is evaporated from the skin\u2019s surface, taking excess body heat with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweat is primarily made of water, just like the human body. Yet, have you ever wondered why when you lick sweat off your lips, it tastes a bit salty? Well,\u00a0as sweat excretes from glands in the skin, it picks up trace amounts of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18156662\" target=\"_blank\">sodium (aka salt), potassium and calcium</a>.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The answer: <em>Maybe</em>?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21057782\" target=\"_blank\">2011 study on the elimination of toxins</a>, \u201cinduced sweating appears to be a potential method for elimination of many toxic elements from the human body.\u201d Chris Woolston, M.S. writes in <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/28/health/he-skeptic28\" target=\"_blank\">an LA Times article</a> that sweat \u201cdoes contain trace amounts of toxins.\u201d However, other expert sources, such as the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, claim that the kidney, liver and intestines are responsible for the <a href=\"https://uamshealth.com/healthlibrary2/medicalmyths/canyousweattoxinsoutofyourbody/\" target=\"_blank\">filtering and elimination of toxins</a>\u2014not sweat.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Essentially, sweating <em>may</em> help you eliminate toxins, but it isn\u2019t a significant amount\u2014nor is it what sweat is designed to do.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While people may think it\u2019s sweat itself that smells, sweat is actually completely odorless. However, bacteria near the apocrine glands (located in the armpits and groin) </span><a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sweating-and-body-odor/home/ovc-20307975\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">breaks down the sweat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which then causes a distinct odor. That\u2019s why deodorant is generally only applied under the armpits, rather than the entire body.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When your body\u2019s natural process are working in balance, sweat isn\u2019t going to help or harm your skin. Sweat is designed to carry out an important process\u2014cooling your body down. However, when combined with other factors, sweat might lead to certain skin concerns like acne or rashes. Which brings us to\u2014</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sweat won\u2019t be\u00a0the sole cause, but it can certainly contribute to a breakout. Your skin accumulates plenty of dirt, oils, makeup and other impurities over the course of a day, (sweat included). These impurities, if left on the skin\u2019s surface, can clog your sweat glands\u2014making it harder for your body to cool down and potentially leading to breakouts. In some cases, your skin may become irritated, leading\u00a0to a <a href=\"http://www.aocd.org/?page=Miliaria\" target=\"_blank\">skin condition called\u00a0milaria</a> (also known as a heat rash). While this will generally resolve itself in a day or two, it\u2019s often preventable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you notice a breakout that occurs in the days following exercise on a regular basis, taking a shower and washing your face\u00a0sooner after the workout might help. Additionally, removing makeup or heavy lotions before working out can help prevent blocked sweat glands and pores.\u00a0While your body needs to go through the process of cooling down, there are a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/5-beauty-expert-hacks-to-stop-sweating-after-class/\">few ways to help keep the sweating in check</a>, especially after exercise.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re sweating excessively or in unwarranted situations, and it\u2019s affecting your everyday activities, <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/dry-sweaty-skin/hyperhidrosis#symptoms\" target=\"_blank\">it might be a sign of hyperhidrosis</a>. Certain medical conditions and side effects of medications or supplements can cause excessive sweating. Conditions include diabetes, menopause, hyperthyroidism and tumors. Talk to your health care provider if you think your sweating habits might be abnormal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In general, sweating is usually nothing to worry about (as long as you\u2019re staying healthy and taking care of your skin!). And it may be a relief to know that everyone sweats\u2014as it\u2019s a completely natural bodily function. However, if you want to sweat less or avoid breakouts after sweating, check out some of our recommendations below.</p>"},

Whether you\u2019re reaching for a hot cup of joe or a steaming mug of tea, your beverage choice sets the stage for a productive morning. What many people don\u2019t realize is that both coffee and tea have their own unique set of health benefits\u2014not just for your body, but for your skin health, too. And those benefits may be available in tea- and coffee-infused topical skin care products as well.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taste preferences aside, which is the better choice for your morning routine? Here are some of the pros and cons of the two most popular morning pick-me-ups\u2014whether you\u2019re sipping away or using one as a topical treatment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antioxidants\u2014whether natural or man-made substances\u2014</span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-do-antioxidants-do/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">function as cell protectors</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When ingested or absorbed through the skin, antioxidants are said to protect against free radicals (unstable molecules that have been linked to everything from cancer to cataracts). Let\u2019s compare the antioxidants in tea versus those in coffee. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12587987\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">class of flavonoids acting as antioxidants</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, catechins are what makes tea so good for the body.

Those are the same free radicals that cause your skin to age, so green tea can actually help you keep your skin looking young, bright and fresh.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though tea tends to get all the credit, coffee also contains plenty of antioxidants. The ones found in coffee are known as phenolic acids (caffeic, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">p</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-coumaric and ferulic). These are a group of antioxidants </span><a href=\"http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/86/3/604.full\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that increase resistance of LDL to oxidation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, thus reducing your risk of heart disease (as it\u2019s not just the presence of the bad LDL cholesterol that causes heart disease, but the oxidation of it). </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (ODPHP), </span><a href=\"https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/chapter-2/a-closer-look-at-current-intakes-and-recommended-shifts/#callout-caffeine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more than 95 percent of adults consume caffeine</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on a regular basis\u2014largely from coffee and tea. Though caffeine is mildly addictive, it is </span><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm350570.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for safe, daily consumption. However, as with all things, caffeine is best enjoyed in moderation. The FDA recommends </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm350570.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">limiting your intake to 400 mg of caffeine per day</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the </span><a href=\"https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Center for Science in the Public Interest</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you exceed four or five cups of either drink, </span><a href=\"https://cspinet.org/tip/beware-these-effects-caffeine-body\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you might experience symptoms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like jitteriness, migraines, nervousness, frequent urination and more severe effects. Some people experience physical dependence (caffeine, though legal, is still a drug) and a vicious cycle of insomnia and fatigue. This is because caffeine <a href=\"https://cspinet.org/tip/beware-these-effects-caffeine-body\">can interfere with the compound</a> in your body that helps you fall (and stay) asleep. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/benefits-of-caffeine-on-skin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">caffeine in moderation isn\u2019t all bad</a>.

While many effects are related to caffeine (see above section), this section compares some of the other components. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tea is one of the most widely consumed drinks in the world and is also one of the most versatile drinks for improving your personal wellness. And we\u2019re talking big improvements; multiple studies suggest that </span><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/melaniehaiken/2013/06/30/green-tea-may-prevent-alzheimers-say-four-new-studies/#51f2b9502e22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">green tea may be effective at preventing Alzheimer\u2019s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2646205/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reducing the risk of breast cancer in women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11029010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tannins in tea may make it more difficult to absorb iron</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014so you may want to consider taking an iron supplement or consuming tea in between meals (as opposed to with your meal) if you are anemic or iron deficient.

However, the benefits of drinking coffee stretch far beyond an extra push to help you get through a busy work day. According to a study in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jf062839p\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coffee can also protect against diseases</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> such as type two diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver and neurodigestive diseases. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the flip side, </span><a href=\"http://www.irondisorders.org/diet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coffee may also inhibit iron absorption</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, due to phenolic acids (the antioxidants mentioned above). Coffee can also dry out your mouth and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-your-teeth-are-aging-you/\">stain your teeth</a>, so the same considerations for tea apply to coffee as well. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though coffee and tea both taste great, they are powerful ingredients in many topical skin care products. You may find tea extract, coffee extract and caffeine in eye creams, body scrubs, face masks, and a variety of other anti-aging products. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant-rich and cancer-fighting properties, green tea extract is used in many skin care products. According to the study \u201cPractical Uses of Botanicals in Skin Care,\u201d </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958188/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">green tea may have anti-aging effects when used topically</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as it can decrease inflammation and protect against free radicals\u2014both of which are known to speed up the aging process. Additionally, other teas like white, red and black are rich in inflammation-fighting, anti-aging components.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More and more, skin products are using extract from the fruit of the coffee plant. That\u2019s because, according to a study in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, coffee extract is said to </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958188/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">increase blood flow and decrease inflammation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, making your skin look bright, young and beautiful. Additionally, a recent study published by the\u00a0National Center for Biotechnology Information suggests that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27195822\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">coffee ground extracts may be useful</a> for reducing wrinkles, preventing water loss and slowing down collagen loss when used topically.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of antioxidants, caffeine content, general health and skin care, both coffee and tea have an impressive list of benefits. So, with the information above, the choice of which to consume is up to you. If you need an extra jolt of caffeine, maybe opt for coffee. If you prefer the taste of tea, brew yourself a nice cup. Both are great for your complexion and your overall health, just in slightly different ways.</span></p>"},

But how much do we really know about sunscreen? What does\u00a0SPF mean? Does a higher SPF mean better protection? To give us the lowdown on SPF, we turned to dermatologist and member of the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_502210.htm\">MDSolarSciences</a> Scientific Advisory Council, Dr. Diane Berson, for help in answering some of the questions that confound most of us about sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Diane Berson:</strong> The SPF of a product only relates to its protection from the UVB or \u201cburning\u201d rays. The SPF of a product does not mean it protects you from UVA or \u201caging\u201d rays. Companies use independent testing companies to test the SPF levels in their products in compliance with the FDA testing guidelines.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing a sunscreen, make sure that you\u2019re choosing a product that has been tested for broad-spectrum protection (protects from both UVA and UVB). That way, you\u2019ll be protected not only from the immediate effects of sun damage (sunburn) but also from long-term damage that shows up as wrinkles, sunspots and worse\u2013skin cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Berson:</strong> An SPF 50 product protects you from 98% of the UVB \u201cburning\u201d rays that penetrate your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before the FDA introduced its new labeling requirements a few years ago, SPF levels caused a lot of confusion for customers. Some people thought that the SPF number corresponded to the number of minutes the sunscreen protected the skin, the percentage of rays the sunscreen filtered, or other misguided logic. The SPF number theoretically correlates to how long a person can stay in the sun without burning. For example, when wearing an SPF 30, you can remain outside for 30 times longer than if you were unprotected. However, that doesn\u2019t take into consideration your skin type, any toweling, swimming, sweating or the level of the UV index that particular day. Confusing, right?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, all sunscreens have mandated directions and water resistance testing results visible on their packaging. Sunscreen can either be effective for up to 40 minutes or up to 80 minutes in water. It\u2019s much easier for people to understand the need to reapply at least every 2 hours. You should reapply every 40 or 80 minutes while swimming or sweating, depending on the product. These directions are now easily seen on the packaging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Berson:\u00a0</strong>Since an SPF 50 protects from 98% of UVB rays and nothing offers 100% protection, there is no statistical significance to using an SPF over 50. Products with higher SPF values may be misleading and give consumers a false sense of security.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When customers see a product marketed as an SPF 100+, some may think that means they\u2019re protected from 100% of the UVB rays, or that the product will work all day. There\u2019s no such thing as a total sunblock\u2014and all products must be reapplied in accordance with the FDA guidelines.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Berson:\u00a0</strong>An SPF 50 offers a high level of protection and is best for those with a history of skin cancer or those that are fair skinned or at higher risk for skin cancer. An SPF 15 covers 93% of UVB rays and an SPF 30 covers 97% of UVB rays. There is a fairly big difference between an SPF 15 and 30 but the difference in coverage lessens considerably between SPF 30 and SPF 50. Protection afforded by products over SPF 50 is only incremental.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Berson:\u00a0</strong>You must look for sunscreens that provide broad-spectrum protection and say so on the label. Only broad-spectrum sunscreens protect you from both UVA and UVB rays. Using sunscreen products that contain antioxidants gives you another layer of protection. Wearing sun-protective clothing, sunglasses and wide-brimmed hats is also important in total sun protective care.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cover up, slather up and read up! Think about it: we are hardwired to check the nutrition facts on foods before eating them, but we should also always check the drug facts on sunscreens. It\u2019s just as important to understand what we\u2019re putting on our skin to protect us and our families.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you\u2019re armed with a higher SPF IQ, it\u2019s time to pack those beach bags and enjoy a fun, sun-safe summer!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>READERS\u2014On the market for a new sunscreen?

But\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Microneedling_504080.htm\">microneedling</a>\u00a0or dermarolling\u2014a minimally invasive cosmetic treatment that involves puncturing the skin with\u00a0needles (or a dermaroller) to trigger\u00a0your skin\u2019s repair process and collagen production\u2014is really\u00a0nothing new. In fact, dermatologists have been performing this procedure for years as <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2840919/\">a treatment for\u00a0facial scars</a>.\u00a0How it works is pretty straightforward: It is performed using\u00a0an apparatus comprised of fine, precise needles that is rolled directly on the skin in a controlled motion. By creating superficial injuries on your skin, your skin reacts by\u00a0speeding up collagen and elastin production to repair your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still, even with solid studies, not to mention the before-and-after shots of people who\u2019ve actually done it, the thought of a hundred needles poking your skin doesn\u2019t sound very encouraging. To help you decide whether this treatment is right for you, we\u2019ve talked to a few\u00a0experts. Here\u2019s what you need to know before trying microneedling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMicroneedling is a safe, chemical- and laser-free method that triggers new collagen production, regenerates skin cells and can also be used to help resurface the skin,\u201d says Natalie Aguilar, a nurse and aesthetician who specializes in the treatment with her sister Nadia at their skin care boutique Afterglow Beverly Hills.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While most often used for resurfacing skin texture, it\u00a0can help improve a variety of skin concerns, including discoloration, enlarged pores, acne scars, wrinkles, fine lines and crepey skin. If you don\u2019t have any major concerns, the therapy can also simply give skin a dewy and more youthful appearance, Aguilar says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An assessment of the client\u2019s skin is typically conducted before the service is performed in order to prescribe the best course of treatment. \u201cWe set a clear goal to be reached and then select the best needle depth and most suitable serum for use with the therapy,\u201d Aguilar shares. \u201cDeep, pitted or severe acne scars would need a greater depth of needling as opposed to clients who are hoping to minimize pore size, which would require less depth.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Serums used during treatment are customized according to the needs of the client. Aguilar uses caviar serum to restore moisture, minimize fine lines and improve skin turgor. Depigmentation serum, which is comprised of six skin lighteners, including glycolic acid, works to decrease the production of melanin and is used for discoloration. For clients with acne, Aguilar uses propolis serum, which minimizes inflammation, heals skin and controls sebum production with salicylic acid and propolis extract.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIn general, microneedling can definitely be painless, but it may feel a tiny bit awkward because of the \u2018prickly\u2019 sensation during treatment,\u201d says Aguilar. However, when the depth of the needle is more extreme, additional precautions are advised. \u201cFor more severe skin issues, it would be best to numb with a topical anesthetic to make the client feel more at ease and comfortable throughout the procedure,\u201d Aguilar advises.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u00a0is considered safe when done correctly, it\u2019s important to ensure your esthetician is licensed to perform the service and is following hygienic practices. \u201cBefore commencing, we suggest making sure that the microneedling apparatus is sterile. Ask the technician to open the packaged needles in front of you for the utmost precaution in safety and infection control,\u201d Aguilar suggests.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re concerned about recovery time, burns or discoloration that can sometimes occur post-laser treatment, microneedling therapy is an excellent alternative. Like laser treatments, it\u00a0can effectively lighten discoloration, resurface texture, stimulate collagen production and plump and tighten skin. It also has the added benefit of reliability. \u201cMicroneedling allows for a more predictable outcome for these skin issues,\u201d Aguilar explains. Unlike lasers, microneedling is also a \u201ccolor-blind\u201d treatment, meaning it can be performed on clients of all skin tones.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Treatments typically run $500.00 to $1,200.00 per service. A variety of factors can drive costs, including the specific serum used during the service and the amount of total treatments needed. These factors are determined by the needs of the client along with his or her age and skin type, which can influence the rate of response to treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Like most cosmetic procedures with a corresponding <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/9-life-changing-beauty-gadgets/\">at-home device</a>, a microneedle treatment at home\u00a0is not only possible but is also more affordable. \u201c</span><span class=\"s1\">A microneedling treatment at home is far more affordable than its in-office counterpart,\u201d shares\u00a0Sarah Perets of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_503809.htm\">ORA Beauty</a>, maker of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Microneedle+Face+Roller+System++WhiteAqua_63690.htm\">Microneedle Face Roller System</a><i>. </i></span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cA lot of what you are paying at a spa or doctor\u2019s office is the professional\u2019s time, liability insurance and facilities.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">While at-home\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">microneedling devices\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">are designed to mimic the results of the in-office treatment, they work rather differently. </span><span class=\"s1\">\u201cSurgical dermarollers are used to treat a wide variety of more severe skin conditions such as deep acne scars. Due to the length of needle, typically are 1 to 3 millimeters compared to at-home devices\u2019 0.2 to 2 millimeters, this type of therapy usually\u00a0</span>requires a topical anesthetic, and in more severe cases, sedation or a general anesthetic,\u201d explains Perets. \u201cIt will be more painful but at the same time it will create deeper holes which may lead to faster results. However, for some, this may <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_The-Pros-and-Cons-of-Microneedling_2082.htm\">pose more risk</a>, causing damage, scarring and post inflammatory pigmentation.\u201d</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cThe at-home treatment is virtually\u00a0pain-free and requires no topical numbing,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe extremely fine needles gently penetrate the skin just enough to stimulate collagen and elastin production. Via microneedling, the dermaroller creates micro channels through the surface of the skin, allowing active skin care product ingredients such as retinol and vitamin C to reach the depths of the skin more effectively.\u201d</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At-home microneedling devices\u00a0also come in larger sizes, which allows you to treat larger areas\u2014like abdomen, thighs, legs, buttocks, hands, arms, neck and back\u2014twice as fast as you would with a smaller roller head. The <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Microneedle+Body+Roller+System++WhiteAqua_63691.htm\">ORA Microneedle Body Roller</a>, for example, f<span class=\"s1\">eatures a wide, double-sized head with 1,080 fine needles, and\u00a0is \u201cdesigned for use on any area of the body to diminish the appearance of scars, stretch marks, cellulite, wrinkles, fine lines and other blemishes,\u201d according to Perets. \u201cThe body roller also helps smooth uneven skin texture and color, and heavy pitted skin in all body areas.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with any at-home beauty gadget,\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">microneedling devices\u00a0ar</span>e not foolproof. Below is\u00a0a step-by-step tutorial on how to use your dermaroller properly on your face or body. For best results, do this\u00a0every three to five days.

Here\u2019s everything you need to know about this summer skin saver.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWhat we\u2019re really doing here with these facial mists is just taking essential oils and putting them into a much thinner form so that they\u2019re water-soluble,\u201d says Dr. Neal Schultz, M.D., New York City dermatologist and the creator of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.beautyrx.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BeautyRx</a>. \u201cA mist is just another vehicle for different ingredients. What we\u2019re doing is using a different delivery system for aromatherapy.\u201d Instead of dabbing an essential oil like lavender on your wrist, you can spritz it directly onto your face (albeit in a less concentrated form, says Dr. Schultz).

Dr. Schultz recommends using this right after a workout or when you\u2019re feeling hot.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Schultz says lavender and chamomile are two great options. \u201cLavender is probably the most popular, as it can help with stress relief,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t beat chamomile as a calming agent.\u201d Eucalyptus, jasmine, cedar wood and tea tree oil are other ingredients to look out for in a face mist. Dr. Jaliman adds that antioxidants (like green tea and vitamin C) are soothing and can brighten your complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spritz one on whenever you\u2019d like to refresh throughout the day, says Dr. Jaliman. If you\u2019re using a face mist solely to attain mood-boosting benefits of an ingredient like lavender, Dr. Schultz says it should be the last step in your skin care routine so that you can really appreciate the scent.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ready to refresh your complexion?

(Oh, my!) </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn addition to hydration and lack of sun damage,\u201d she adds, \u201chealthy skin is also even in color, is smooth, firm and elastic.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cCompared to measuring your blood pressure or cholesterol, measuring healthy skin is much less objective,\u201d says Ponzio-Guarino. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to begin with measures of unhealthy skin and those would include poor texture, lack of moisture, non-elasticity and uneven tone.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Unhealthy:</strong> \u201cIf your skin is rough, bumpy or blotchy,\u201d says Ponzio-Guarino, \u201cthese are clear unhealthy measures.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Healthy:</strong> Your skin should look and feel smooth. Consistency among the appearance of pore size and hair follicles should be present.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Unhealthy:\u00a0</strong>Often used interchangeably (<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Dry-vs.-Dehydrated-Skin%3A-Whats-the-Difference%3F_2022.htm\">because they have similar symptoms</a>), dry and dehydrated skin are two separate\u00a0concerns.\u00a0If your skin is red, dry, tight or flaky, it could very well be dry and/or dehydrated. Even if your skin is oily, it could still be dehydrated. This is because without enough water in your skin, your pores can overcompensate by producing more sebum. Though we do produce oil to help our skin, an excess of it has the potential to create a bacteria-loving environment that we do not want to host!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Unhealthy:</strong> As we get older, our skin produces less elastin, making it thinner. Factor in high amounts of damage, unhealthier skin will be unable to bounce back and more susceptible to wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Unhealthy:</strong> Uneven skin tone is the first sign, but Ponzio-Guarino also emphasizes that <em>tanned</em> skin is unhealthy skin. \u201cEven if you aren\u2019t burning,\u201d she explains, \u201cif you\u2019re tanning your skin, you\u2019re damaging it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Getting healthy skin isn\u2019t going to happen overnight (sigh), but there are four key practices you can explore in order to reverse skin damage and wake up each morning with healthier skin than yesterday.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIt is important to wear sunscreen every day,\u201d Ponzio-Guarino says. \u201cRe-apply every two hours, wear cover-ups, sunglasses and hats. Do not ever step into a tanning salon. According to the Melanoma Research Foundation, just one visit under the age of 30 increases your risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent. It\u2019s just not worth it. My favorite brand of sunscreen is <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_EltaMD_500300.htm\">EltaMD</a>.

This is especially true for oils that can increase your skin\u2019s sensitivity to light or thicker oils that might give your complexion a little too much shine for a daytime look. If you have dull skin, Anis also suggests using face oil as a primer before applying makeup. Allow the oil to fully absorb before applying your makeup for a natural, hydrated glow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Alex Roher, MD of <a href=\"http://sdbotox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">San Diego Botox Inc</a>\u00a0recommends using face oils both in the morning and at night. He advises applying oil as the last step of your <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/nighttime-skin-care-routine/\">nighttime skin care routine</a>\u00a0and before your sunscreen and makeup in the morning.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anis and Renee both agree that\u00a0you shouldn\u2019t be rubbing the oils into your skin like you would a moisturizer. Instead, </span><em>dab or pat</em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the oils, pushing them into your pores, rather than\u00a0just sliding them around on the skin\u2019s surface. This will help your skin absorb the oil and make use of\u00a0its benefits much quicker.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because face oils contain such concentrated amounts of nutrients (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thecut/2016/02/02/everything-you-need-to-know-about-beauty-oils/#4da9d56f1a54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marula oil has four times the vitamin C as an orange</a>!), a little bit goes a long way. One to three drops of your choice of oil is\u00a0enough to cover your whole face and deliver the benefits your skin needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key to using face oils and actually getting benefits from them is <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wrinkles-acne-or-itchy-scalp-theres-a-beauty-oil-for-that/\">choosing the right oil</a> (or blend of oils) for you. Here are some of the best oils for aging, dry, oily and sensitive skin types\u2014with suggestions provided by both Anis and Diane Elizabeth, Founder of <a href=\"https://www.skincareox.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skincare Ox</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you age, your skin produces less oil, which means you get dried out more easily. This, for many women, exaggerates the look of wrinkles. According to Anis, facial oils</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0can \u201creduce your wrinkles because they contain essential ingredients like\u00a0antioxidants</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d and pass through the skin quickly, preventing water loss and keeping the skin plump. Antioxidants boost collagen production and strengthen skin elasticity, thus reducing fine lines.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best oils for aging skin:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Argan+Oil_49977.htm\">Argan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Rosehip+Triple+CE+Firming+Oil_65717.htm\">rosehip seed</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether your dry, parched skin is weather dependent or a year-round concern, face oils can be part of the remedy. Quick-absorbing, nutrient-rich face oils help to deeply moisturize and smooth your skin. For dehydrated skin, you may want to use a hydrating serum first, followed by a moisturizing oil to lock in all of the benefits of the serum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best oils for dry skin:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Travel+Size+Maracuja+Oil_62531.htm\">Maracuja</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Organic+Argan+Oil_57268.htm\">argan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Olive+Virgin+Oil_38038.htm\">olive</a>, sunflower, jojoba and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Raw+Coconut+Cream_39899.htm\">coconut</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overly stripping oily skin in an attempt to get rid of oily shine actually <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Build-an-Anti-Aging-Regimen-for-Oily-Skin_2026.htm\">causes your skin to produce more oil to compensate</a>, creating\u00a0a vicious cycle. Certain oils can actually help balance your skin\u2019s oil production, get rid of excess oil on your face and minimize\u00a0the appearance of pores. According to Anis, certain oils can dissolve excess sebum and remove grime and fats from pores, thus minimizing their appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Debbie Palmer also <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-double-cleansing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recommends using an oil-based cleanser</a> to help rid your skin of makeup, pollutants, dead skin cells and other impurities. She suggests choosing a cleanser that is hypoallergenic, non-comedogenic and designed for sensitive skin for the best results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free radical\u2013fighting antioxidants also protect your skin and combat future damage by reducing cellular oxidation, one of the processes by which skin ages. By tackling free radicals, products like those containing\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">primrose oil</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0or those with a vitamin E base protect against and reduce damage from the sun. (But, no, they don\u2019t block UV rays.) Be sure to apply sunscreen after massaging a few drops of face oil </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">onto your skin in the morning.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face oils have anti-inflammatory properties, which means they can calm the skin and reduce rashes.\u00a0</span></p>"},

According to them, certain crystals and stones possess\u00a0properties that could ward off negative energy, lift the spirit\u00a0and facilitate healing\u2014both the mind and body. Reaping the rewards of these mystical wonders\u00a0may be just as easy as holding onto a stone, wearing them around your neck or <span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">slathering </span>a crystal-infused cream onto your face. But how do these mystical wonders work? Read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But how do they actually work? Crystal healing or gemstone therapy is based on the idea that all matter is composed of energy, and crystals have energy that resonates with natural vibrations in the human body. \u201cSometimes people are healed by seeing the beauty of the crystal,\u201d explains Heather Askinosie, crystal expert, co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.energymuse.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Muse</a> jewelry and co-author of the upcoming book\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Crystal-Muse-Everyday-Rituals-Tune/dp/1401952380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i>Crystal Muse: Every Day Rituals to Tune Into The Real You</i></a>. \u201cSometimes people are healed by a crystal because they touched it and it made them feel good. And sometimes people are healed with a crystal because when they had one in their house it made them feel light and airy. The thing with crystals is that they like to be touched and felt. When we touch a crystal, another human being or anything else, it deepens the connection and there\u2019s a synergy that happens.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there aren\u2019t a lot of scientific studies that support the healing benefits of crystals\u2014<a href=\"http://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=09462104&amp;AN=49115546&amp;h=Mwz6o%2fQsYfAtw%2bOaPydHCpgmtailwb7jUb9h5WR76uk45OHxEI3dpevjywZEB%2fcq%2bUzK8AYSqfQXU9RcQnyfEw%3d%3d&amp;crl=f&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d09462104%26AN%3d49115546\">one study even claims</a>\u00a0that the perceived benefits of these stones could be just a placebo effect\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">anecdotal reports and testimonials abound.

When we are grounded and centered we make better decisions.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to providing mood- and health-boosting benefits, certain crystals and gemstones also <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/most-luxurious-beauty-products/\">deserve a place on your face</a>.

Dermstore, alone, carries <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Retinol_300042.htm\">hundreds of products</a> containing\u00a0retinol. Retinol is part of the retinoid family (also known as vitamin A) and doesn\u2019t require a prescription\u2014although there are prescription options for stronger strengths. With the help of a few dermatologists, we\u2019ve confirmed some facts and busted a few myths about this superhero ingredient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Beverly Hills dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"https://jasonemermd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jason Emer, MD</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, using retinol and vitamin C, also known as L-ascorbic acid, together is not a good idea. \u201cAlthough both, in theory, would be good together as they are both powerful antioxidants, each one has a particular pH that allows the ingredients to work in the skin,\u201d he explains. \u201cL-ascorbic acid has a pH of 3.5 whereas retinol has a much higher pH of 5.\u201d This doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t enjoy the benefits of both retinol and vitamin C. According to Dr. Emer, using one in the morning and one at night might give you the results you want\u00a0without irritating your skin. \u201cI prefer to use my vitamin C during the day to fight free radical damage and my retinol, peptides and growth factors at night,\u201d he says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause retinol is a powerful antioxidant,\u201d says Dr. Emer, \u201cit is important to use it every day.\u201d To encourage everyday use, he recommends\u00a0starting with a lighter dose of around 0.05 percent and working your way up as your skin becomes adjusted. Starting with a stronger concentration may be too aggressive for first-time users. And because retinol exfoliates the skin and produces new collagen, the initial results may be overwhelming. \u201cIt is better to use a lighter dose of a 0.05 percent every night,\u201d Dr. Emer says, \u201cso your skin can retain all the benefits of the vitamin and get those cells turning over more quickly.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Retinoids_1917.htm\">both are retinoids</a>, retinol and Retin-A vary greatly in their chemical makeup and strength. Retinol is a form of vitamin A that naturally occurs in the skin, whereas Retin-A is a\u00a0chemical compound that is\u00a0related to vitamin A. Retinol is the ingredient found in over-the-counter vitamin A products, typically at a low concentration. Because of the lower concentration, it can take a few weeks to a few months for you to start seeing results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retin-A is the brand name of tretinoin, a synthetic retinoid that can only be prescribed by a doctor. Retin-A is much\u00a0stronger than retinol and is widely prescribed for skin rejuvenation and acne. The reason being that the strength of Retin-A enables it to boost collagen, increase\u00a0cell turnover, diminish wrinkles and smooth the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most people only apply their retinol at night because it makes the skin more sensitive to light. \u201cRetinol can actually be used both during the day and at night,\u201d explains Dr. Emer, \u201cespecially if you are using it in combination with other ingredients to lighten brown spots. Just make sure that you use a sunblock to protect your skin from the sun.\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-reasons-retinol-is-your-best-anti-aging-weapon/\">Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Ashley Magovern</a> also addresses this misconception: \u201cWith older formulations, the sun could potentially break down the active ingredient, but this is not the case with most of the newer formulations. At any rate, we still usually recommend that you use your retinol product at night. But there is no reason to avoid it in summer months. You may be a little more likely to burn as you are getting used to it, but with time your skin should become more resilient, healthy and free of sun damage.\u201d<br>\n</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because retinol and other retinoids can cause the skin to flake (usually if the dose is too strong for your skin), they\u2019re often compared to exfoliants. However, retinoids and exfoliants\u2014like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) and beta hydroxy acids (BHAs)\u2014affect the skin much differently. While retinoids penetrate deep into the skin\u2019s layers to improve skin health, <a href=\"http://www.paulaschoice.com/expert-advice/skincare-advice/myths/five-retinol-myths-busted.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AHAs and BHAs exfoliate the skin\u2019s surface to remove dead skin cells</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinoids can be combined with other products to encourage cell rejuvenation, revitalizing the topical skin layer while improving collagen production. <a href=\"http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Joshua Zeichner</a>, a Manhattan dermatologist, notes that retinoids are frequently combined with other products to get the best outcome. A 2015 study suggests that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633208/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids produce a synergistic effect</a> when used together.\u00a0Subjects cleansed with AHAs and then applied\u00a0a retinol-based anti-aging serum twice a day (in addition to SPF 50+), which proved to be safe and effective for\u00a0skin with moderate-to-severe photo damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is no one-size-fits-all for individual skin care needs. In some cases, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Everything-You-Need-to-Know-About-Retinoids_1917.htm\">retinol may work fine for those who are looking to reduce fine lines and wrinkles</a>, but in some\u00a0situations, it may not be strong enough to treat other topical skin issues. It is best to consult your doctor to address your skin needs and find the best product that works for your skin type. Keep in mind, \u201cretinol is also sensitive to UV and will degrade unless it is encapsulated,\u201d says Dr. Emer. <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/where-to-apply-sunscreen/\">Always apply sunscreen</a>\u00a0when using these products to protect your skin, and store your retinol products in a dark, cool place to prevent them from losing their efficacy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Ready to get started?\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">See\u00a0our top 10 retinol products</a>.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A self-proclaimed wellness junkie, Jessica Gomes is a freelance writer and health enthusiast who currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

It\u2019s also important to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/new-sunscreen-formulas/\">always wear sunscreen</a> to prevent sunburn in the discolored patches.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you need more reasons to never skip sunscreen, here\u2019s another one for you: white freckles or idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (IGH). \u201cYou cannot get this color back.

Or is it a mole? Or is it a freckle that turned into a mole? What do you do when a new spot shows up on your skin? We\u2019re breaking down the differences between these common skin spots to help you analyze your own skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smartest thing you can do for your skin\u2019s health is decoding those dots. When are they something to embrace, and when are they something to worry about? We talked with Seattle dermatologist </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/dr-heather-d-rogers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heather D. Rogers, MD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help us spot</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the differences.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freckles are the stamp of summertime: golden, tan speckles where the sunshine kissed the skin. And just like most summer flings, they tend to fade away as colder months approach and are gone by winter. Dr. Rogers tells us that\u2019s because freckles are caused by two things: sun exposure and genetics. If your freckles stick by you year-round, it\u2019s the latter. So what creates those sun-induced spots? </span><a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/skin-and-hair/5-skin-spots-you-shouldnt-worry-about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Melanin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which is a pigment produced from UV rays. It\u2019s the same chemical that gives us an even suntan. So while many women return from a tropical vacation with a glowing bronzed look as a souvenir, fair skinned girls often take home freckles instead.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And while many people consider them endearing, not everyone is excited to have them. So what\u2019s the solution? \u201cRegular use of sunscreen and sun protection can be utilized to prevent the freckles from darkening,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. Using bleaching creams, retinol creams or lasering to lighten them can also do the trick.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like freckles, moles appear due to sun exposure and genetics and are <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Moles/Pages/Introduction.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">created from a similar chemical makeup</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But, unlike freckles, Dr. Rogers explains, they may not be harmless. Moles can be benign (harmless) or malignant (cancerous), and it\u2019s not always easy to tell (more on that in the next section).\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Rogers tells us there are three basic types of moles:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for a way to get rid of them? Not so easy. \u201cBecause moles develop from deeper in the skin than freckles they are harder to lighten or remove,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cCreams do not work. Lasering can lighten them, but they typically grow back and you do </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want to laser a brown spot unless you are 100 percent sure it is not a melanoma.\u201d Essentially, you can either embrace them or see a dermatologist about steps to surgically remove them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freckles are no danger to us, but they are a marker of significant sun exposure and fair complexion\u2014both of which are </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-does-skin-cancer-look-like/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">risk factors for skin cancer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Moles are another chapter completely, as some growths can be malignant (cancerous). Just as the differences between a flat mole and a freckle can be unclear, the differences between a benign and malignant mole can also be subtle. The bottom line: When in doubt, visit a dermatologist.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those times and more, Dr. Rogers gives us the lowdown on when to make an appointment with your dermatologist: \u201cStarting at the age of 18, people should have skin exams. If you have more than 100 moles, a family history of skin cancer, a history of multiple sunburns or are over the age of 40, you should get a skin exam at least once a year.\u201d Additionally, \u201chaving many moles or atypical moles is associated with an increased risk of melanoma. Melanoma can develop in moles or as a new spot that can look like a mole. Therefore, if you have a changing brown spot, go see a dermatologist.\u201d</span></p>"},

Drinking plenty of water improves your body\u2019s overall health and does great things for your largest organ: your skin. Glow from the inside, out.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do you have oily skin, dry skin or combination? Take stock of what your skin is up to by looking at the size of your pores and where you typically get oily or dry. According to Dr. Funt, larger pores are a sign of oily skin and needs plenty of astringents and retinoid to balance oil production. \u201cProducts like astringents, retinoid and benzoyl peroxide decrease sebum or oil, and help eliminate shine,\u201d says Dr. Funt. \u201cOily skin is caused by hormone changes which cause excessive sebum and enlarged pores.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We Recommend:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Hydra+Medic+Astringent+For+Oily+Problem+Skin_38968.htm\">Repechage \u2013 Hydra Medic Astringent for Oily Problem</a><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Hydra+Medic+Astringent+For+Oily+Problem+Skin_38968.htm\"> Skin</a><br>\nIf your skin dries, cracks or peels during the summer you may want to adjust your environment. \u201cDry or ashy skin can be due to lack of moisture from overuse of products that dry skin like retinoid or benzoyl peroxide, change in estrogen levels due to menopause or workplaces with dry environments and excessive air conditioning or lack of humidity,\u201d says Dr. Funt.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We Recommend:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Active+990+MultiAction+Day+Cream_59282.htm\">Bliss \u2013 Active 99.0 Multi-Action Day Cream</a><br>\nThis day cream is dreamy for dry skin.

The words \u201cchemical\u201d and \u201cpeel\u201d may sound scary at first, but this FDA-approved treatment literally gives you a fresh face of skin\u2014and it\u2019s been growing in popularity, with <a href=\"https://d2wirczt3b6wjm.cloudfront.net/News/Statistics/2016/2016-plastic-surgery-statistics-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approximately 1.36 million treatments received in 2016</a>.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The chemical peel is the process of applying a chemical solution to the skin to smooth out its texture. It can be used to treat many skin issues like acne, fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation. A form of chemical exfoliation, a peel allows your skin to shed off a layer, making room for new, healthier skin. \u201cPeels are great for everyone to do,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/18187-2/\">Dr. Ashley Magovern</a>. \u201cThey slough off tired, dull skin cells and stimulate fresh healthy skin, allowing for accelerated cell turnover and the stimulation of collagen-making cells.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn how to prepare yourself for a chemical peel properly and what to expect during and after the procedure, we sought advice from both Dr. Magovern and esteemed clinical aesthetician Jennifer Gerace.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before making the decision to get a chemical peel, Gerace recommends getting the opinions from at least three providers first, noting that \u201cproviders should take into consideration your age, the color of your skin and overall skin condition.\u201d Don\u2019t be fooled by the one-size-fits-all peel, as \u201cthe peel\u2019s intention should be very specific to the patient\u2019s needs,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To prepare the skin for the treatment, be sure to stop the use of all <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Exfoliants+Peels+and+Scrubs_300079.htm\">at-home exfoliants</a>\u00a0in the days leading up to your appointment. Exfoliants like retinol and salicylic acid hide in many of our beauty products. If you continue to use them before your appointment, it can cause trauma to the skin, which may result in more damage. If you have sensitive skin, it is recommended to stop using physical exfoliators like face scrubs and devices such as the Clarisonic.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Magovern stresses the importance of keeping your skin hydrated and moisturized before your appointment. \u201cTry to keep your skin as hydrated as possible,\u201d she says, also noting that \u201cyou may want to stop any creams or serums that may be causing dryness for two to three days.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, take into consideration any anti-acne or anti-aging prescriptions you are using, as these might affect the way your skin reacts to a chemical peel. If you need help determining if your products are okay to use prior to your chemical peel, talk to your dermatologist or esthetician who will be able to assist you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The last step in preparation is to be sure to plan accordingly! If you are getting a chemical peel before a special event, make sure you\u2019ve budgeted plenty of time for your skin to heal so you look picture perfect on your big day.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDuring a chemical peel, the skin will begin its intense peeling process,\u201d says Gerace. You will have the option to choose which peel you want, though it\u2019s wise to choose an intensity based on your professional\u2019s opinion. \u201cChemical peels vary from very light to medium depth.\u201d </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin, your skin care professional will ask you to lie face up to establish a smooth surface for application.\u00a0The entire process usually takes under an hour to complete, and your skin care professional will typically stay in the room to ensure there are no adverse reactions as it dries.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the peel is applied and begins drying, you may feel a burning or tingling sensation due to its high acidic chemical composition. The amount of burning or tingling will vary based on the type of chemical peel you are receiving and will differ case to case (e.g. you might be more sensitive than another person getting the same peel). </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, Dr. Magovern notes that even those with sensitive skin can find a suitable chemical peel. \u201cContrary to popular opinion,\u201d she says, \u201cpeels don\u2019t have to sting or burn or cause a lot\u00a0of redness and inflammation to work.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Gerace, the type and depth of the solution will dictate how long the skin will peel.\u00a0\u201cThe traditional medium-depth chemical peels take three to five days for the skin to peel off before the new pink skin underneath arises,\u201d she explains, while \u201cdeeper peels that contain phenol can take seven to ten days to recuperate from.\u201d Dr. Magovern notes that the peeling should start on or around the third day after a peel, not immediately after.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Magovern recommends the \u201cuse of a gentle cleanser and a hydrating serum or gel, like one that contains hyaluronic acid or ceramides\u201d to help soothe the skin in the days following a chemical peel. You may also want to treat the\u00a0new skin right away with a combination of stem cell and light therapy, Gerace explains. \u201cThis addresses the health of the new skin cells at a cellular level and is your opportunity to reset your skin and start fresh,\u201d she says. Integrating potent aftercare solutions such as colloidal silver, Botaniceutical and marine algae extracts will help hydrate, stabilize and protect the new skin. \u201cThese ingredients will boost the skin\u2019s ability to fight free-radical damage at this early stage, which is so important and often overlooked.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The chemical peel is used to accelerate the exfoliation of dead skin cells to reveal fresh, new skin. The biggest risk during this process is sun exposure, and Gerace highly recommends using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SPF+5060_500164.htm?keyword=spf%2050-60\">high, broad-spectrum SPF</a> to keep the skin safe during the delicate time following the procedure. \u201cThe skin is thinner after a peel and very susceptible to UV damage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is essential to use a physical block like makeup foundation along with your SPF for at least two months after receiving a chemical peel.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gerace also explains the importance of keeping the skin cool, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t let hot water touch your face as any inflammation can spike post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH).\u201d She urges you not to take hot showers and keep your water at room temperature or colder.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you aren\u2019t ready to take the plunge and go for an in-office chemical-peel treatment, we recommend trying an at-home peel.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/skin-care-while-pregnant/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">What to Expect (From Your Skin) When You\u2019re Expecting</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Lindsay Tigar \u00b7 August 3, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you\u2019re expecting your first child, those nine months are full of firsts. From feeling the flutter of little, growing legs inside your tummy to not being able to button your jeans, it\u2019s an experience unlike any other. The same goes for those newborn days, when every laugh, cry, smile and movement is fascinating (and sure, exhausting).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While there are many beautiful memories during these early stages of parenthood that you\u2019ll cherish, there are some that you\u2019ll probably wish you could skip right over. Due to shifting hormones, normal weight gain and breastfeeding, there are several skin issues that are far from comfortable when you\u2019re pregnant or a new mom. Though all treatable, some of these blunders (looking at you, stretch marks) may be a tad more long-lasting.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here, dermatologists share their best advice for handling such skin troubles:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On average, doctors recommend women gain between 25 and 35 pounds when they\u2019re pregnant. Much of this weight goes directly to your stomach or your breast, sometimes <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-causes-stretch-marks/\">resulting in red or purple stretch marks</a>. While many products might claim to help you prevent stretch marks, <a href=\"http://dermatologyandlasergroup.com\">Dermatologist Dr. Arash Akhavan</a>, MD, FAAD says the only guaranteed way to lower your risk of stretch marks is based on genetics.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, <a href=\"http://www.drkovaklaser.com/\">dermatologist Dr. Stanley Kovak</a> notes that specific ingredients found in lotions and oils can be beneficial. When shopping, check the back label for \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">alpha-hydroxy acid</a>\u201d since this may help minimize their appearance. Another way to keep stretch marks from rearing their head? \u201cBelieve it or not, exercise can help diminish or prevent stretch marks,\u201d explains Dr. Kovak. Thanks to frequent movement, your skin may battle against these marks since it will be stronger and more conditioned. Post-pregnancy, Dr. Akhavan adds you can also invest in non-invasive, effective and safe skin-resurfacing lasers that can make significant improvements to bothersome stretch marks you earned from pregnancy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A distressing and somewhat scary side-effect of pregnancy for some women is melasma, a skin hyperpigmentation condition. While it can happen anywhere in your body, Dr. Kovak explains it traditionally appears on the cheeks, forehead and upper lip, forming red, blotchy patches. He explains this issue is often referred to as \u201cthe marks of pregnancy\u201d and is sometimes heightened by sun exposure. Just like any other time in your life, it\u2019s super important to wear a gentle, broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect not only your own health, but that of your growing babe, too. The good news about melasma is that it usually clears up after you give birth, and if not, can be solved with a laser treatment post-nursing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Cellular+Protection+Sun+Cream+SPF+50_71786.htm\">The Organic Pharmacy Cellular Protection Sun Cream SPF 50</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Akhavan explains that thanks to a fluctuation in hormone levels (hello, mood swings!), many women struggle with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hormones-acne-aging/\">breakouts throughout their pregnancy</a>. Though normal, the bad news is that many traditional treatments for acne are off-limits when you\u2019re carrying a baby. \u201cIt\u2019s important to avoid certain acne medications, even over-the-counter ones, that can potentially have harmful ingredients for the fetus. Always check with a dermatologist or your obstetrician to be sure the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-acne-remedies/\">acne products you are using are safe</a>,\u201d he notes. This is when paying attention to ingredients is important, as Dr. Kovak notes cleansers with alpha-hydroxy acid may help reduce unwelcome zits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Congrats! You had your beautiful baby and six months later, he or she is finally sleeping through the night. You\u2019ve lost almost all of the baby weight and you\u2019re getting into the groove of being a mom, with one annoying catch: the loose skin around your belly just won\u2019t tighten. \u201cWomen complain about the loose skin throughout their body after pregnancy, particularly on the breasts, abdomen, thighs and arms. Rising levels of estrogen can loosen collagen within the dermis, leaving the skin looser after childbirth and breastfeeding,\u201d explains plastic surgeon <a href=\"http://www.kareplasticsurgery\">Dr. Raffy Karamanoukian MD FACS</a>. Once you\u2019ve had your last child, Dr. Karamanoukian suggests radiofrequency treatments to tighten the affected areas, which he notes is a popular trend for moms. \u201cThe treatment of loose skin around the breasts and abdomen are among the most popular post-pregnancy cosmetic treatments. In fact, tissue tightening is quickly outpacing plastic surgery as a first-line mommy-makeover treatment after pregnancy,\u201d he explains. At home, try applying\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-cellulite-body-firming-creams/\">firming creams,</a> or lotions designed to boost circulation and tone your skin, to help make your skin appear tighter and smoother.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though when you were taking prenatal vitamins, you may have adored your strong, silky locks and fast-growing nails, once you jump for joy over those two blue lines, your manicure might take a hit. Dr. Kovak explains many women experience nails that split or become rough when they\u2019re expecting. He says maintaining your nail care during pregnancy is important, just make sure that if you\u2019re using a nail polish, consider\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-safe-is-your-nail-salon-7-best-nontoxic-nail-polish-brands-you-need-to-know/\">non-toxic nail polish brands</a>. While you might be frustrated with your fingers throughout those nine months, he notes that most of the time, your nails will more than likely return to normal post-delivery.</p>"},

According to the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/01/health/plastic-surgery-most-popular-study/index.html\">recent data released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons</a>, last year saw more people opting for cosmetic treatments that promise immediate, selfie-ready results. Among the most popular treatments done in 2016? Dermal fillers, which are injected to plump thin lips, soften deep lines and wrinkles, fill recessed scars and improve facial contour. Data showed that in 2016, there were 2.6 million procedures performed\u2014all in the name of pillowy lips and a smoother complexion!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But for those of us who aren\u2019t huge fans of the needle\u2014or can\u2019t afford a procedure that costs $600 a pop\u2014our options have always been limited to topical products that promise the same plumping effect, like <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/\">hyaluronic acid serums</a>. And though great at boosting our skin\u2019s moisture levels and easing our dehydration lines, these serums aren\u2019t designed for quick, more dramatic results. So if you\u2019re looking for a happy medium\u2014one that offers more visible results than your typical topicals but doesn\u2019t cost as much as in-office treatments\u2014 here\u2019s a product you might want to consider: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Fillerina_504812.htm\">Fillerina.</a>\u00a0This brand features hyaluronic acid fillers in varying \u201clevels\u201d that you can administer at home\u2014no esthetician experience required! And just for the record, that scary-looking syringe in the photo (included in the product package) is merely an applicator, not an actual needle!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to know if this 14-day, at-home cosmetic treatment is right for you? We reached out to the experts at Fillerina to learn more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillerina features the same ingredient as Restylane and Juvederm, which is hyaluronic acid (HA). The difference is that, while Restylane and Juverderm use very large molecules of HA, Fillerina\u2019s formula contains varying sizes of HA, from very small to the same large size, which penetrate all layers of the skin. Office fillers are large and injected, which creates an instant plump and can be overdone. Fillerina penetrates all layers and takes 14 to 21 days to plump the skin and bring it back to the level it was 5 to 10 years ago. \u00a0Fillerina will not ever over plump.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over-the-counter (OTC) serums do not have six molecules, nor do they have the small size that Fillerina has. OTC serums only penetrate the top layers of the skin; Fillerina is able to penetrate all layers and work from the bottom out.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillerina will maintain in-office injections and make them last longer. Regarding serums, there is no need for them if one uses Fillerina. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillerina has five grades and therefore will work on people of all ages. Grade 1 is for a younger person, who just wants to add volume to her lips and cheeks and perhaps fill in fine lines. If this person doesn\u2019t want to use the full treatment, the Day, Night and Eye/Lip Creams are a perfect starter regimen for this person. G2 is for the average-age skin with moderate wrinkles and lines. G3 and higher is for the older skin with deeper wrinkles and signs of sagging. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillerina works on all ethnicities and sells in 34 countries worldwide. It also works on all skin types.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Results will start showing in the first week, full results in 21 to 30 days.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">About three to four months. It is recommended to repeat the treatment before this, however, when the product is still in the skin instead of starting all over again. The more you use Fillerina, the better and more results will continue to show.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, Fillerina is for at-home use. The precise applicator allows you to take control of where you want filling, plumping and lifting. Remember, the applicator is NOT A NEEDLE! It allows you to put the filler gel only where you need it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillerina is a 14-day treatment and must be used for 14 consecutive days, so you need to make sure you have the time to do so. Otherwise, it really is for everyone. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, HA is an existing natural ingredient already in our skin and body. We are simply replacing what we have lost from aging. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HA absorbs 1000 times its weight in water. In order to get best results from Fillerina, you must remember to drink two glasses of water each night prior to treatment and after treatment to stay hydrated. Many do not drink water. Also, Step 2 of the Treatment, the Nourishing Film, is very important. Some do not do this step. The Film acts as a tightening mask while sleeping and locks in the molecule so it can penetrate all levels of the skin. This step should not be skipped.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Fillerina Creams will enhance the Treatment during the 14 days and maintain the results for a longer period if used after the treatment. 30% of the ingredients in all creams are the 6 HA molecule formula, therefore they do the same as the treatment, just not as intensely.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curious to see how Fillerina works, we asked two of Dermstore\u2019s in-house estheticians to try Fillerina for 14 days. Here\u2019s what they have to say, as well as before and after pictures:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>First Impressions:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy first impression was the packaging was beautiful and unique. I have never tried a product before that had a syringe applicator. The feature that stood out to me is the key ingredient in the product (hyaluronic acid), hoping that it would benefit my concerns, which was deep wrinkles around my upper lip and smile lines.\u201d\u2014C.R., late 50s</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI like the sterile bottle that did not have access to open air! I had never used anything with a \u2018syringe\u2019 but the precision was attractive. I am starting to develop fine lines and surface dehydration. I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect, but I was open to anything that would help.\u201d\u2014R.J., 37</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>On Ease of Use:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI found it easy to apply, I did not need any help applying.\u00a0The instructions are easy to follow. I watched the video just out of curiosity.\u201d\u2014C.R., late 50s</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSo the serum went on relatively easy. The nourishment cream, however, did not suck into the syringe very well and I ended up breaking the syringe and lid on accident.\u00a0The instructions in the kit were simple, but almost too simple. There was a lot of room for interpretation, which led to some guessing.\u201d\u2014R.J., 37</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Results:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe treatment felt a little sticky and did come out a bit thick until I learned how to dispense it more gently. It smells great, I love the smell of the moisturizer and the feel of it as well. No tingling at all, but I did feel my face has softened.\u201d\u2014C.R., late 50s</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWhen I first applied the product, my skin immediately felt \u2018full.\u2019 I was definitely surprised. It felt plump immediately, but the feeling dissipated quickly. Overall, the hydration did improve.\u00a0The biggest benefit I noticed was improved hydration and feel after applying the products.\u00a0I noticed an improvement in the hydration and supple feel on my skin within a couple days.\u201d\u2014R.J., 37</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31290\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bf-fourhead.jpg\" alt=\"Fillerina Review: Before and After Pictures 1 | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31289\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ba-neck.jpg\" alt=\"Fillerina Review: Before and After Pictures 2 | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31287\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ba-eyesandlips-2.jpg\" alt=\"Fillerina Review: Before and After Pictures 4 | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-31288\" src=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ba-neck-2.jpg\" alt=\"Fillerina Review: Before and After Pictures 3 | Dermstore Blog\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tips for Best Results:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMake sure you use it every day, I have found that if I keep the first solution on a bit longer before the moisturizer, that seemed to help.\u201d\u2014C.R., late 50s</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI would recommend adding it to an anti-aging routine as a booster or in lieu of a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d in-office filler.

We grow and develop normally, feel energized and experience fewer mood swings. But, one little imbalance can throw everything off. And nothing is more evident that something is off balance than an acne breakout. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help us better understand how hormones relate to acne, we turned to board-certified dermatologist </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/18187-2/\">Dr. Ashley Magovern</a>, who explains the\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acne and birth control connection.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been pointing the finger at hormones for your acne, you\u2019re probably putting the blame in the right place. According to Dr. Magovern, \u201cMost acne in women has a \u2018hormonal\u2019 component, as even the \u2018normal\u2019 hormones can cause oil production and contribute to acne.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, unfortunately, hormonal issues don\u2019t discriminate based on age. \u201cWhen teenagers start to produce oil, we see them start to break out,\u201d she says. And adult women \u201ctend to break out more around their menstrual cycle as the surge of hormones just before the cycle causes oil production.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Note: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all breakouts are caused entirely by hormones.

Dr. Rebecca Booth, board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist, notes that </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hormones-acne-aging/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">estrogen-based birth control pills can help regulate hormones</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and prevent acne breakouts as well. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both types of pills work by \u201ckeeping your hormone levels steady and preventing the cyclical hormone surges that can contribute to oil production,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. More than </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0012780/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 trials, conducted on more than 12,000 women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> support the notion that birth control can be an effective treatment for acne. In fact, when compared to antibiotics\u2014another popular treatment for acne\u2014birth control pills are shown to be </span><a href=\"http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622%2814%2901291-2/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a better long-term solution for acne management</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wait\u2014the same thing that\u2019s supposed to help with acne can actually make things worse? Maybe. However, it depends largely on the type of hormones in the pill, how your body adjusts to the new regimen and lifestyle/environmental factors. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Magovern says, \u201cBirth control can contribute to or cause acne.\u201d More specifically, she explains, \u201cthe ones that contain progesterone, like Depo Provera or the Mirena IUD, can cause acne.\u201d Even in women who\u2019ve generally experienced clear skin, some types of birth control can elicit a breakout.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every woman\u2019s body can react differently to different types and amounts of hormones, which is why it might take a couple of tries and communication with your doctor to find the right balance for you. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it can be very effective for many women, your doctor may not recommend using birth control to manage your acne. For starters, your doctor will want to take into consideration the severity of your breakouts and determine what could be causing them. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you\u2019ll also want to take into consideration your overall health and your family history. \u201cPatients who have migraines, high blood pressure and those with a strong family of history of breast cancer or clotting disorders need to be careful,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cIt\u2019s best to speak with your physician about these types of concerns.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know how you\u2019re supposed to finish taking the pack of antibiotics even after you start feeling better? It\u2019s because the antibiotics are treating the cause\u2014not just the symptoms. This same concept applies to breakouts. Dr. Magovern explains: \u201cThe trick is to prevent the breakouts by treating your skin even on the clear days with a good daily regimen that will keep your pores \u2018clear\u2019 so that the oil won\u2019t cause a blockage.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re struggling with breakouts, be sure to cleanse your face every day. Then, add in an acne-fighting cream, gel or serum. Dr. Magovern says, \u201cBenzoyl peroxide and antibiotic-containing creams and gels work well, but the retinoid-containing products really help maintain clear skin on a long-term level.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kaitlin Willow wears many hats at Dermstore: copywriter, marketing/SEO strategist and community manager.

(And How to Prepare for Your First One)</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Sara Romero \u00b7 August 14, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facials are ah-mazing. If you want a clear, well-hydrated complexion and more youthful appearance, a facial may be a nice addition to your skin care routine. Millions of people enjoy the relaxing, skin-improving features of a facial on a regular basis.\u00a0According to a recent study, <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/276868/us-households-professional-personal-care-services-used--facials/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">more than 15 million Americans had multiple facial treatments in 2016</a>, approximately 66 percent more than those who selected massage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, they\u2019re definitely popular, but what do facials do? And what do you need to know before booking one? Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about facial treatments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A professional facial is designed not just to help you relax, but <a href=\"http://cosmeticscop.com/2016/09/19/should-you-get-a-facial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to help improve your skin</a>. \u201cFacials are customized treatments for the face, neck and d\u00e9collet\u00e9 that can help prevent and treat common problems,\u201d says Christine Walsh, esthetician at <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/features/ds_spa.php\">Dermstore Spa &amp; Salon</a>. Having a smooth, glowing complexion is only part of the allure; facials can also:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can book a facial with an esthetician at your dermatologist\u2019s office or a day spa. Ultimately, the decision of where to book depends on what\u2019s most comfortable and convenient for you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMany brands offer their \u2018signature facials\u2019 targeting many skin concerns,\u201d says Walsh. However, she notes that there are tons of different facials, each designed for a specific type of skin or concern. These are: \u201cdeep cleansing facials, acne prevention facials, rejuvenating facials, anti-aging facials, brightening facials, light therapy facials, enzyme facials, oxygen facials, chemical peels, microdermabrasion facials, fruit acid facials, cold globes or gem facials, gold facials, vampire facials, acupuncture facials, organic facials, electric current facials and lymphatic drainage facials.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most popular, especially during the summer months, says Walsh, are brightening facials, rejuvenating facials and oxygen facials.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cKnow what products you are currently using and what your main skin concerns are,\u201d says Walsh. This is your best way to ensure the results you want and avoid irritating your skin during or after the treatment. \u201cAvoid using harsh exfoliating products about four days prior to your treatment,\u201d Walsh continues. \u201cMen should not shave the morning of their facial. It\u2019s not ideal to come into the treatment with a sunburn; however, there are still calming treatments that could be performed.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Preparing for a wedding or special event? Don\u2019t schedule a facial for the night before. Walsh notes that it\u2019s best to book a facial at least a few days before the event so your skin looks its best. Want to ensure full relaxation during your facial? Walsh recommends turning off your cell phone during your appointment and enjoying the moment. She also suggests avoiding wearing jewelry to your appointment, as \u201cmost facials come with a massage while you are masking.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Post-treatment breakouts and irritation are possible <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_The-4-Top-Skin-Sensitivity-Causes_2012.htm\">if the products used were too harsh for your skin</a> or if your pores weren\u2019t cleared and cleansed properly. To minimize redness and blemishes following a facial, you should always follow any specific instructions your esthetician gives you and cleanse your skin with a gentle, non-comedogenic cream or foam. Also, It\u2019s best to skip toner for the first few washes after your facial; your freshly cleaned skin doesn\u2019t need it. Because your skin may feel sensitive following a facial, avoid harsh cleansers and vigorous scrubbing for 48\u201372 hours following your treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facials last an average of 60 minutes; however, what to expect largely depends on your skin. Your experience will depend upon the type of facial you want and your skin type. For example, some facials are designed to help improve certain skin concerns, like acne, and may include extraction (of blackheads/whiteheads) or chemical exfoliation. Others might just hydrate and nourish the skin through a series of steps.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the type of facial, Walsh explains that \u201csome tools may be used on your complexion such as the woods lamp, high frequency, microdermabrasion and microcurrent\u201d to help enhance your results. She also adds that your esthetician may provide \u201c</span>knowledge on your skin type and how to maintain a proper home care regime.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with any treatment, it\u2019s best to check with your doctor if you are pregnant, breastfeeding or have any specific health concerns before scheduling any facial treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the summertime,\u00a0it\u2019s best to skip chemical peel and more intense resurfacing\u00a0treatments\u2014as these actually remove the top layer of skin, making it extra sensitive and susceptible to sunburn and UV damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have extremely sensitive or acne-prone skin, you may want to ask your dermatologist for specific recommendations, as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Finding-the-Best-Facial-Peel-for-Your-Skin-Type_1971.htm\">some types of facials and peels can irritate your skin even further</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your face is one of the most exposed parts of your body\u2014and, therefore, one of the first areas to start showing signs of aging or environmental stress\u2014so treat it with care (and a little pampering, if you so choose). Not ready to visit a professional just yet? You can give yourself a gentle at-home facial using one of the products featured below.</p>"},

The trick to caring for your skin is </span><a href=\"http://media.dermstore.com/images/homepage/Facing-Forward.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">knowing your skin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> because understanding means you can find the right products that work for you and combat potential issues without causing more problems. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are seven basic skin types: normal, oily, dry/dehydrated, combination, acne-prone, sensitive and mature. Learn how to identify and care for yours below.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0You don\u2019t experience many breakouts. Your skin doesn\u2019t tend to react negatively to new products or weather changes. You don\u2019t feel like you need to constantly moisturize or blot oil from your face all day long. Your skin is firm, with minimal fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:</strong> Lucky you! With normal skin, you experience almost no sensitivity, dryness or oiliness. Your skin can tolerate most ingredients, meaning you can play hard with beauty products and have tons of fun experimenting with cleansers, moisturizers and masks until you find exactly what works for you. \u00a0\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0Your skin always seems to be glowing. You\u2019re likely no stranger to blotting sheets or mattifying powders. You might find that makeup and skin care products don\u2019t always stay put like you\u2019d want them to.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With oily skin, shine control is a top concern. Although there are </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">benefits to having oily skin\u00a0(like\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_4-Surprising-Benefits-of-Oily-Skin_2073.htm\">fewer wrinkles!</a>)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you should avoid ingredients like mineral oil, petrolatum and alcohol. Products labeled \u201cnon-comedogenic\u201d work great for oily skin as these won\u2019t clog up your pores. Oil-free moisturizers are your best friends (<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/your-burning-questions-about-moisturizers-answered-by-a-dermatologist/\">yes, you still need to moisturize!</a>), as are chemical exfoliants and clay masks. Be sure not to over-wash your face, as drying out your pores <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Control-Oily-Skin-During-the-Day_2009.htm\">can cause them to produce even more oil to compensate</a>.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Dry-vs.-Dehydrated-Skin%3A-Whats-the-Difference%3F_2022.htm\">Dryness and dehydration are actually two separate concerns</a>, but they have very similar symptoms. Here\u2019s how to identify them in your skin:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To care for dry skin, you\u2019ll want to seal in moisture by applying a rich moisturizer several times each day\u2014especially after washing your hands or bathing. Try to keep the air in your home warm and moist to help heal. Avoid using harsh soaps or products containing citrus oils or lots of fragrance. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your skin is dehydrated, on the other hand, be sure to look for water-based products, as oil-based products can actually make your skin condition worse. Most important, be sure you\u2019re drinking enough water each day!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0If you\u2019re having trouble figuring out what type of skin you have, it\u2019s likely combination. Is your skin dry in certain areas, while oily in others? Combination skin is most easily defined by an oily T-zone (the strip across the forehead and the line down the nose) and dry or normal skin on the rest of the face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll want to stay away from the same ingredients as oily and dry skin, such as alcohol-based products. The name of the game with combination skin is balance. Isolate problem areas with spot treatments and use toners or\u00a0balancing cream to even out the skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0If you get frequent breakouts (or ones that just never seem to go away), you likely have acne-prone skin. This means that your pores tend to clog easily, making you more susceptible to whiteheads, blackheads or pustules than other skin types. You can have oily or dry skin and be prone to acne.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Important Note:</strong> Blemishes on your skin might not necessarily be acne. In fact, a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_8-Telltale-Signs-You-Have-Rosacea-%28and-Not-Acne%29_1984.htm\">common skin concern called rosacea</a> is often known as \u201cadult acne\u201d because it can cause acne-like symptoms. Other symptoms of this condition include flushing, prominent blood vessels, thickened skin and stinging or burning. (If this sounds more like your skin, skip down to the \u201cSensitive\u201d section instead.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use cleansers specifically formulated to treat acne, as well as exfoliants and moisturizers that will help minimize breakouts. Gently cleanse your face to avoid trauma to existing breakouts, and use topical gel to treat and lighten acne scarring. Look for <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_The-4-Best-Ingredients-for-Acne-Prone-Skin_2025.htm\">acne-fighting ingredients</a> like salicylic acid, clay, benzoyl peroxide or retinol.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0Sensitive skin might be caused by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_10-Signs-You-Have-Sensitive-Skin_2076.htm\">genetics, allergies or environmental factors</a>. Signs of this skin type include:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin Care Tips:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Sensitive-Skin-Tips%3A-A-Guide-to-Choosing-Products_1942.htm\">be careful when choosing cosmetics</a>, as you\u2019re more prone to irritation, redness, stinging, burning or acne breakouts. Avoid fragrances and irritants like alcohol or antibacterial ingredients. Look for products with fewer additives, and seek out those with calming, healing or anti-inflammatory properties.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Tell:</strong>\u00a0While not everyone\u2019s skin ages at the same pace, the signs are fairly universal.\u00a0You might notice a wrinkle here and there or more dryness than in your younger years.

Unfortunately, the world is neither perfect nor free of acne-causing bacteria, so we turn to science to help us achieve clear and blemish-free skin instead. One of the most common ingredients in anti-acne skin care products is benzoyl peroxide, often found in cleansers, toners and treatment gels. Many swear by its effectiveness, but what some may not know is how it works exactly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Synthesized in a lab, benzoyl peroxide is an antibacterial ingredient that</span> <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top-3-acne-ingredients/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">kills off the acne-causing P. acnes bacteria</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that live deep in the pores and survive on oil, cell debris and skin tissue. It penetrates the skin and treats acne from the source while reducing redness and inflammation. \u201cThose with mild-to-moderate acne use benzoyl peroxide in a variety of topical medications,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist Janet Prystowsky of</span> <a href=\"https://livadskincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Livad Skincare</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fast-acting and accessible, benzoyl peroxide is a popular first-line defense against acne and comes in different strengths\u2014usually at 2.5, 5, and 10 percent. \u201cDepending on the severity of your acne and your skin sensitivity, you may choose a higher or lower concentration,\u201d says Dr. Prystowsky. For first-time users, start with a lower percentage to reduce the risk of redness, flakiness and dryness\u2014common side effects when using the wrong amount or when mixed with the wrong ingredients.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt works well with ingredients that open pores like retinoids and adapalene, but I recommend against using it with salicylic or strong glycolic acids as these combinations will be too irritating for some,\u201d explains Dr. Prystowsky. Another ingredient you should steer clear of when using benzoyl peroxide? Dapsone. \u201cIt will turn your skin orange!\u201d she warns. For best results, Dr. Prystowsky recommends using the right type of treatment products as directed, daily for most face washes and as necessary for treatment creams and gels. Washes are great for back acne while gels and creams work best for the face.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to try this proven acne fighter?

Trick question! Moisturizers are a spectrum from water to vaseline\u2014with lotions, creams and ointments being varying combinations of the two.

You\u2019ll find common emollients such as petroleum jelly and mineral oil, plus </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">waxes</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> used to thicken the creams and seal in moisture.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lotions have the most added ingredients. Why? Because they are placed toward the water end of the spectrum. The <a href=\"http://www.nova.org.au/people-medicine/chemistry-cosmetics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher the water content, the easier it is for bacteria to form</a>. To combat this,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">preservatives</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (like parabens, benzyl alcohol or salicylic acid) are used\u2014usually between the levels of 0.01 percent and 5 percent. Fragrances are then often added to mask the scent of these ingredients. This is why we normally use lotion for the body and heavier products on our (more sensitive) faces. These additions <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/parabens-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">aren\u2019t necessarily harmful to the skin</a>\u2014just be sure to apply and see how your skin feels. If you feel any sort of burning sensation, your skin is telling you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it\u2019s a no.</span></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Creams, lotions, gels and oils all feel very different when you apply them. A cream is a very standard thick moisturizer that we use for those extra stubborn flaky areas like our elbows or applied all over the face before bed. Are you left with a greasy feeling? While maybe not ideal for daytime use, the greasy-feeling creams are often most effective at <a href=\"https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/moisturizing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keeping moisture in and irritants out</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know that big bottle of your favorite moisturizer you use every time you hop out of the shower? It\u2019s easy to apply all over the skin, absorbs quickly and lets you get on with your day? That\u2019s your everyday lotion. Being very light on the skin, it hydrates without feeling heavy or sticky. This low-viscosity skin-saver has the greatest percentage of water in the formula, which is what makes it the simplest and most economical option.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heavier-duty moisturizers with a higher oil and wax content are ideal for dry skin. Extremely dry skin or <a href=\"https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/moisturizing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">those with</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0eczema</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> benefit greatly from thick creams and ointments (basically anything toward the petroleum end of the spectrum) because of their moisture-locking and protective qualities. Always be sure to listen to what your skin tells you. If your skin feels dry and irritated, that\u2019s your body\u2019s way of telling you it needs moisture.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face and body lotions soak into the skin quickly so you can pamper your dehydrated skin and get on with your day. Normal-to-combination skin types (balanced skin with some areas experiencing dryness or oiliness) benefit most from a gel cream or a lotion as these formulas add light and creamy care while also providing just a hint of oil to protect the skin\u2019s moisture barrier. Have oily or acne-prone skin? Choose something with <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/moisturizer-for-oily-skin/\">low levels of emulsifiers and oils</a>. Going out on a hot day? Water-like textures are best for humid areas so as to not clog pores and prevent your makeup from slipping and sliding in the heat.</span></p>"},

Here\u2019s What We Found Out</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jessica Griffiths \u00b7 August 22, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saunas have a rich history of relaxation and rejuvenation, dating back centuries to when the Finnish would make theirs by digging huts into mountainsides or building log cabins. Although their look has evolved, saunas remain a fixture of modern beauty regimens for countless people who cite amazing benefits to their skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">saunas good for your skin? What is it about them that leaves you feeling so refreshed? We spoke with board-certified dermatologist </span><a href=\"http://www.eringilbertmd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Erin Gilbert, MD, PhD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to discover the relationship between saunas and your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Gilbert says, \u201cThe thing about saunas is that you\u2019re getting pore dilation, you\u2019re opening up your pores.\u201d Pores are designed to help us regulate our temperature, she explains. \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing in a sauna is you\u2019re saying, \u2018Hey guys, it\u2019s really hot in here, I need to get cooler.\u2019\u201d Part of the way your body cools down is by opening your pores and sweating. Being in a sauna, therefore, is like \u201cexercising your pores.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Gilbert believes the act of sweating is extremely detoxifying, \u201cNot only for your body, but for your skin.\u201d Through sweating, you\u2019re removing impurities (aka toxins) from your skin, and the process is highly restorative and rejuvenating. Cleaning out or unclogging your pores can also minimize future breakouts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spending time in saunas means you\u2019re getting improved circulation to your skin, which, Dr. Gilbert says, \u201cis effectively going to make your skin look healthier and better.\u201d The increased circulation means more nutrients are being delivered to your skin, she explains, and more blood flow will see your skin glow with a rosier, healthier complexion.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saunas may cause discomfort for those with sensitive skin. This is because, Dr. Gilbert points out, people with sensitive skin have sweat with a higher concentration of salt in it, and this can lead to irritation.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For people with </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Rosacea_400054.htm?keyword=rosacea\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rosacea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, saunas can be worrisome. Dr. Gilbert explains that because saunas can \u201cencourage and permanently alter the number of red blood cells on your face,\u201d it may mean that individuals who suffer from rosacea may not be able to recover from blushing as rapidly. Skin conditions like </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eczema_400027.htm?keyword=eczema\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eczema</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Psoriasis_400020.htm?keyword=psoriasis\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psoriasis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may also be irritated by saunas, so if you have either of these, it\u2019s best to check with your dermatologist before trying out a sauna.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re having an adverse skin reaction after visiting a sauna</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">even a few hours later</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and your skin is feeling itchy, it may be because the salt is still sitting on your skin. Taking a shower or washing your face can help alleviate this discomfort.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re brave enough to try it, a cold shower after the sauna will create a circulatory shock of sorts, which can be very rejuvenating for your system and your skin. Regardless of the temperature of the water, \u201cto prevent any irritation, and also for the sake of those around you in any enclosed spaces,\u201d Dr. Gilbert advises, \u201cyou should shower after the sauna.\u201d </span></p>"},

In other words, you probably forget to wash your face at night, barely apply moisturizer before heading out the door and always let your hair air-dry post-shower.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone has their own approach to beauty and if you\u2019re more of a natural gal than the type who enjoys practicing winged eyeliner via YouTube videos, you probably prefer the more hands-off approach to getting ready in the morning.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being low-maintenance isn\u2019t a bad thing, but if you\u2019re going to be a tad lazy when taking care of your skin, you want to pick multitasking beauty products that get the job done, without much effort.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are the easiest ways to make sure you\u2019re keeping your skin clean and healthy:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to clean your face every night before you go to bed, but sometimes you just can\u2019t be bothered. Instead of guilting yourself to splash water and cleanser on your face, keep a pack of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Refreshingly+Clean+Makeup+Remover+Wipes_68776.htm\">Honest Beauty\u2019s Refreshingly Clean Makeup Remover Wipes</a>\u00a0on your nightstand so you can at least attempt to rid of the day\u2019s cat-eye before shut-eye.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u2019s true you\u2019re not supposed to wash your hair daily because it prevents it from producing healthy oils and nutrients, going a full week without a deep cleanse? Probably not the best for your locks. Instead of keeping up with a shampooing schedule, invest in a dry version like this one from <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Healthy+Locks+Dry+Shampoo+Powder_62031.htm\">One Love Organics</a> that will keep oil out, leaving you with fresh-looking hair, no matter what.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019ve heard of the 10-step nighttime beauty routine, right, but who has time for that?

This\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Cleansing+Gel++Cleanse+Tone+Makeup+Remover_50047.htm\">Cleansing Gel from HydroPeptide</a> does exactly that: it cleanses, tones and removes makeup while promoting a more youthful complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Being low-maintenance about everything means your makeup tricks haven\u2019t really evolved since high school. While that\u2019s totally fine, you might want to at least try the latest trend in eye, cheek and lip color. Instead of separate buys, many products like\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Lip2Cheek_39886.htm\">RMS Beauty\u00a0Lip2Cheek \u2013 Smile</a> combines all three, so you only have to lug around one for a mid-day touchup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For acne-fighting and deep-cleansing treatments, your dermatologist might recommend three different products. While you want to do what\u2019s best for your pores, you also can\u2019t be bothered to work triple-duty, all the time. Instead, give <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Wild+Rose+Advanced+Brightening+Sleeping+Facial_69417.htm\">Wild Rose Advanced Brightening Sleeping Facial by Korres</a> a whirl.

Although you might find yourself freaking out at the way your face looks, thankfully, swollen eyes are usually more of a nuisance than a serious problem. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They can occur for a number of reasons, ranging from allergies to an infection, or even from just rubbing them too hard. \u201cHowever, if the swelling is constant, worsening or becoming painful, it can signify a potentially more serious health issue such as orbital cellulitis, Grave\u2019s disease or ocular herpes, and a visit to the ophthalmologist is necessary,\u201d says </span><a href=\"http://www.advanceddermatologypc.com/newjerseydermatologists.html#hu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Judy Hu</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, dermatologist with Advanced Dermatology, P.C. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do get swollen eyes occasionally, there\u2019s no need to freak out. But if you find that you wake up with puffy eyes more often than you\u2019d like, you might want to look into the root of all your swollen eye troubles. Here are six reasons you could get swollen eyes in the morning (and how to treat each one).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cOne of the most common reasons for waking up in the morning with swollen or puffy eyes includes excessive salt intake,\u201d says Hu. \u201cAccumulation of salt from diet leads to the body holding onto excess water. In many cases, the water tends to accumulate in the connective tissues around the eyes and especially lower eyelid.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decreasing your intake of salty food can help with swelling. \u201cTry to drink a lot of water to wash away the salt,\u201d says RealSelf contributor and\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.realself.com/find/New-York/New-York-City/Dermatologist/Michele-Green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York-based dermatologist, Dr. Michele Green</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like eating too much salt, drinking too much alcohol can lead to dehydration and cause swollen eyes the next morning. \u201cAlcohol causes dilatation of the blood vessels, and where there are dilated vessels, fluid accumulation can occur,\u201d says Hu.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drink plenty of water before bed and after you wake up. You can also try an eye cream that contains tea, which will \u201cfirm and hydrate while minimizing the appearance of fine lines, dark circles and puffiness,\u201d says </span><a href=\"http://www.eastsidedermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermatologist Dr. Alan J. Parks.</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eye allergies and seasonal allergies also play a large role in puffy eyes. \u201cAllergic reactions occur when the body\u2019s immune system overreacts to a foreign substance such as pollen or dust,\u201d says Hu. \u201cHistamine is then released, which causes the blood vessels in the eyes to dilate and swell, again leading to accumulation of fluid as well as itchiness in the area and a runny nose.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take an over-the-counter allergy medication like Claritin, Allegra or Zyrtec. If that doesn\u2019t work, see a doctor for allergy testing. \u201cThis will also allow you to avoid anything you\u2019re allergic to and you can also get a prescription allergy medication if the over-the-counter products are not strong enough,\u201d says Parks.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of us tend to scratch or rub the eyes from time to time, perhaps even in our sleep or when we wake up. \u201cThese actions are actually traumatic to the delicate skin around eyes and eyelids causing inflammation and swelling to the area,\u201d says Hu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTry not to rub your eyes, and apply a cooling mask and cold milk compresses to eyes before bed and in the morning,\u201d says Green. The cold milk has an anti-inflammatory effect and can help soothe and calm the skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, there are anatomical reasons for skin looking swollen around the eyes that can also have to do with genetics. \u201cEveryone has collagen around the eyes that hold back the fat pads under the lower eyelids,\u201d says Hu. \u201cWith aging, the collagen and elastin fibers around the eyes become weaker, which subsequently leads to protrusion of the fat pads that were under those collagen fibers. Clinically, this can be seen as swelling or puffiness of the lower eyelid.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTo increase collagen, do Thermage laser, which is like increasing the collagen bank for your skin,\u201d says Green. This non-invasive treatment gives your skin a smoother, sleeker look.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Been feeling overworked or stressed about your relationship? It might be showing in your eyes. \u201cStress causes it by increasing cortisol and changing the salt balance,\u201d says Green. Crying can also cause eye puffiness, even if it happened the night before. When you cry from emotions, the tears produced are less salty than normal tears, so water flows back into your ocular tissues around the eye\u2014which are normally saltier\u2014and causes swelling of those tissues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to cut down on your stress. \u201cYou can try working out, as this may relieve your stress as well,\u201d says Parks. You can also try a product like a cucumber eye cream, which reduces signs of fatigue, puffiness and dark circles around the eyes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carina Wolff is a health and wellness writer based out of Los Angeles.

Toner is one of those weapons we hear so much about, but what is toner and how does it work for your skin?\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A toner is used to complete the cleansing of the skin, effectively removing impurities that remain after washing your face. A well-formulated toner can enhance and replenish the skin after you remove your makeup and cleanse. Board-certified dermatologist </span><a href=\"http://www.eringilbertmd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Erin Gilbert, MD, PHD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> describes toners as a nice \u201cself-care moment that gives you that spa feeling.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In discussing the myriad qualities of toners, Dr. Gilbert explains they offer different benefits\u2014depending on your skin type and the ingredients in the formula. She gives a few examples, stating that toners can soothe skin, tighten skin or balance out oil production. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The efficacy of the toner depends on its active ingredients, and you should be particularly conscious of your skin type when selecting a toner. Here are the ingredients to look for when choosing a toner for your skin type\u2014along with our top recommendations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Gilbert says, \u201cFor people who are acne prone and need to get rid of excess oil, that can be achieved by a toner.\u201d Look for products with </span>salicylic acid <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">as the active ingredient as it gently exfoliates and removes dead skin, while also increasing cell turnover and collagen production. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try: </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Acne+Clearing+Toner_1417.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glytone Acne Clearing Toner</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For combination skin, </span>lactic acid<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0is a godsend. This is because it hydrates dry skin, but does so gently and thus works for sensitive skin as well.

Because our skin tends to erupt at the slightest trigger\u2014hormonal fluctuations, seasonal changes and certain skin care products\u2014knowing the ingredients we put onto our skin ensures we\u2019re not only treating existing breakouts but preventing future ones from happening as well.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two ingredients that we consistently see in acne regimens are <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/salicylic-acid-products/\">salicylic acid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-benzoyl-peroxide/\">benzoyl peroxide</a>. That\u2019s no accident: These two are the gold standard when it comes to keeping our pores clean and acne-causing bacteria at bay. But what\u2019s the difference between the two, how do they work and which one is right for you? To get the lowdown on these two powerful acne fighters, we reached out to Dr. Alex Khadavi, MD FAAD, board-certified dermatologist, associate clinical professor of dermatology at the University of Southern California and creator of the three-step acne system </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Clearogen_501342.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearogen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dr. Khadavi, both ingredients are effective at treating acne, the main difference lies in how they work. \u201cSalicylic acid as a medication is used most commonly to help exfoliate the outer layer of the skin,\u201d he explains. \u201cWhen applied topically for acne, it opens clogged pores in order to neutralize bacteria while preventing pores from clogging up again. It also promotes shedding of epithelial skin cells, allowing room for new cell growth.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If salicylic acid dissolves dirt, oil and dead skin layers that clog the pores, benzoyl peroxide works by penetrating the pores and killing acne-causing bacteria with oxygen. \u201cBenzoyl peroxide breaks down in contact with skin in order to produce non-toxic benzoic acid and oxygen, which is effective at breaking down comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) and inhibiting inflammation,\u201d he says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you know which one\u2019s better for you? According to Dr. Khadavi, there might not be a need to choose. \u201cThere\u2019s no magic bullet to kill acne for everyone,\u201d he explains. \u201cBoth help clear acne in different ways so the best way to address acne is with multiple active ingredients.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To do this, he suggests using both of these active ingredients at small percentages in different application methods and times for a synergistic effect. Below is what he recommends.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Salicylic Acid:</span> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cUse topically in a cleanser and/or toner formula and apply to the areas affected.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Benzoyl Peroxide:</span> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor acne treatment, apply to the affected areas in gel, cream or liquid, in concentrations of 2.5% increasing through 5.0% and up to 10%. I recommend using the lowest concentration and build up as appropriate. I don\u2019t recommend 10% benzoyl peroxide solutions as they\u2019re just too harsh for the skin.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still unsure of how to build your acne skin care regimen on your own, ask your dermatologist, or consider opting for a treatment system like </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_3Step+Acne+Treatment+Set++Benzoyl+Peroxide_28073.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearogen\u2019s three-step acne system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which features a combination of both salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide in the right amounts to tackle acne from all sides.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have sensitive skin and are worried about side effects, Dr. Khadavi suggests treading with caution. \u201cFor salicylic acid, dry skin is the most commonly seen side effect but can be avoided or minimized by using low percentages and using formulas made for sensitive skin with non-comedogenic moisturizing ingredients,\u201d he explains. \u201cBenzoyl peroxide commonly causes initial dryness and sometimes irritation, although the skin develop</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s tolerance after a week or so. Irritation can also be reduced by using mild facial cleansers, a barrier-repairing lotion and wearing sunscreen prior to sun exposure.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pregnant or nursing? Jury is still out on whether these two ingredients are safe to use topically during pregnancy, and that\u2019s why the FDA doesn\u2019t permit use of either. If you can\u2019t use both, Dr. Khadavi recommends using sulfur instead.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSulfur is a great anti-inflammatory and as well as antibacterial ingredient,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will help clear acne and help heal the skin. This is also a great solution for people with rosacea, acne and combination skin. Sulfur will help soothe redness as well as clear and prevent acne.\u201d \u00a0</span></p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-do-clay-masks-work/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">How Do Clay Masks Work? We Asked an Expert</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Deanna Pai \u00b7 August 31, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing that feels quite as satisfying as a clay mask, especially when you\u2019re dealing with a fresh breakout or your skin feels extra greasy. The way the clay hardens and tightens on your skin can make it feel like it\u2019s really, truly, definitely working. But are they truly doing that much for your skin? And how do clay masks work? The good news: Clay has legitimate benefits, especially for certain skin types. Here\u2019s exactly how clay masks work\u2014and what they can do to improve your skin in the long run.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you had a dollar for every clay mask ever produced, you\u2019d be en route to somewhere warm on your private jet. It\u2019s not only masks, either. Clay is popular in skin care products, in general, because it\u2019s so effective at clearing out skin. \u201cClays help to detoxify the skin and draw out impurities and oils from the surface of the skin,\u201d says cosmetic chemist Peter Konish, the Director of Product Development and Strategic Product Innovation for the Prestige Beauty at Johnson &amp; Johnson. \u201cThis is especially helpful to those people with acne or oily-prone skin.\u201d But even if you\u2019re not plagued by breakouts\u2014in which case, lucky you\u2014clays can be rich in minerals and acids that can benefit other skin types, too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have oily or acne-prone skin, you may already be very familiar with clay masks. Clay is popular for these skin types for good reason. \u201cIt helps draw out the impurities as well as absorb excess oils that are on the surface of the skin,\u201d explains Konish. \u201cAdditionally, it helps reduce excess shine.\u201d You can kiss your clogged pores goodbye.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t struggle with pimples, clay can still offer a detoxifying experience. In some cases, clay masks can even hydrate your skin\u2014which is essential if you\u2019re dealing with dryness, since clay\u2019s ability to absorb oil can actually exacerbate dryness. \u201cLook for those that are more hydrating and containing hydrating ingredients such as glycerin and sodium hyaluronate,\u201d suggests Konish.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After you mask (or, if you\u2019re game, </span><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/a-girls-guide-to-multimasking/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multimask</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), Konish recommends following through with your usual skin care regimen, which should consist of cleansing followed by serum followed by moisturizer. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, try using a moisturizer with salicylic acid, which can help control acne all day or night, like </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Clear+Skin+Probiotic+Moisturizer_48259.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eminence Organic Skin Care Clear Skin Probiotic Moisturizer</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Konish, they may vary in their composition of minerals, such as silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, potassium oxide and calcium oxide, as well as in their physical structures. Here\u2019s how three of the most common types of skin-beneficial clays stack up:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Green Clay:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find it in </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Mermaid+Detox+Face+Mask_67288.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Captain Blankenship Mermaid Detox Face Mask</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Facial+Mask++Japanese+Matcha+Tea+with+Acai+Goji+Berry_22177.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pangea Organics Japanese Matcha Tea with Acai &amp; Goji Berry Facial Mask</span></a>.

But this commonplace facial condition alludes toward the ambiguous. What exactly are the pores clogged with? What does it mean? And how can one </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">un</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clog them? The internet yields a number of remedies to unclog your pores ranging from the gentle to the extreme. We sat down with some experts in the field\u2014dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.dermla.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Yuri M. Kim, DO</a> and esthetician <a href=\"http://www.beautybykaroly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Karoly Spring</a>\u2014to figure out the best ways to unclog your pores, with or without the presence of an acne breakout and also to look a bit further into the internet\u2019s most viral unclogging trend.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Kim, \u201cClogged pores occur when oil, dirt or dead skin cells start to build up. This can be caused by makeup, not having a good skin care regimen, bacteria, sweat, excessive oil production and even hormones.\u201d Clogged pores often catch a pointed finger as an acne-causing culprit, which is not unfounded. However, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-mistakes/\">clogged pores are not the sole cause of acne</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This buildup of dirt, oil and dead skin blocks and clogs your pores thus making your skin prone to possible acne breakouts. The signs of clogged pores are pretty tell-tale. Dermatologists and estheticians alike confirm that the presence of blackheads and whiteheads means that your skin could benefit from a refreshing cleanse.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSometimes patients may start to develop whiteheads or blackheads under the skin. If there is more inflammation, then that is when the \u2018pimples\u2019 start to form. The face will look dull and not refreshed,\u201d says Dr. Kim. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spring agrees and adds, \u201cYou can also feel your face with your fingers and notice a bumpy, rough surface.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is saturated with these addicting-to-watch videos. The videos situate a well-lit shot, framed shoulders-up of some wide-grinning millennials seemingly covering their faces with charcoal paint. Clever editing and a speedy time-lapse show the paint hardening into a face mask. And then: bam! The climax. The moment we all stalled on the video to see\u2014the peel off. The satisfyingly slow pull and peel shows the viewer just how clogged pores can be, and by the same token, the necessity of the face mask to unclog and prevent acne.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This viral face regimen has stormed the internet in droves; however, because of the very nature of the digital sphere, cutting and editing omits some of the less glamorous sides the compelling face mask pull. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the popular products have harsh ingredients that do not bode well on sensitive skin. Also, the very act of the pull can be too aggressive, removing skin and doing more damage than it\u2019s worth.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere should be little to no pain when unclogging your pores,\u201d says Spring. \u201cThe right preparation and ingredients make a great difference.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Kim suggests a couple of ingredients to look for when seeking a remedy that won\u2019t be too rough for your skin: \u201cOver-the-counter washes with benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid may help with clogged pores. These can help exfoliate your skin and help open up your pores.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Across the vast skin discipline, various experts agree that, while clogged pores can certainly lead to acne problems, the face-mask sensation sweeping the digital realm may not be the most effective treatment.

The cosmetic procedure\u2014which includes drawing blood from your arm, separating platelets and injecting them into your face\u2014became popular when Kim Kardashian had it performed on an episode of</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Kourtney and Kim Take Miami.</span></i></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re like us, you might be wondering how it works, what the benefits are and if this procedure is something you should incorporate into your routine. To get some answers, we spoke with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kaylynplum/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kaylyn Plum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a physician\u2019s assistant and Director of Noninvasive Aesthetics at </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/gothamplasticsurgery/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gotham Plastic Surgery</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vampire facial is done through microneedling. Professionals use a microneedling device \u201cto safely and precisely create controlled micro-injuries to the skin,\u201d says Plum. Then platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is injected into the skin to \u201ctrigger new collagen and elastin production, break up existing scar tissue and make the skin look and feel smoother, brighter, tighter and more youthful,\u201d explains Plum.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Performed using brand-name tools such as\u00a0Dermapen and MicroPen, microneedling (without the PRP) is a minimally invasive treatment that involves puncturing the skin with fine needles to promote collagen production. Microneedling is not just exclusive to the face. The procedure can be performed on \u201call areas of the face, neck, d\u00e9colletage and hands,\u201d explains Plum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, both facial treatments improve the skin\u2019s texture and help to reduce unwanted wrinkles. Healing time is the major difference between the two treatments. With traditional microneedling, you can expect \u201cfive to seven days of redness or downtime,\u201d says Plum. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microneedling with PRP, or the vampire facial, decreases downtime to 24 hours. How? By using platelet-rich plasma, \u201cYou are essentially healing the micro-injuries to the skin as they are inflicted,\u201d explains Plum. \u201cThe rich growth factors and healing properties within the PRP stimulates greater collagen formation and boosts the skin\u2019s natural healing process.\u201d She emphasizes that microneedling with PRP is superior to traditional microneedling because you can achieve better results with fewer treatments.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPeople have been utilizing microneedling treatments for many years,\u201d says Plum. However, professionals have \u201crecently discovered the greater benefits of combining microneedling with PRP.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis treatment is primarily used to address skin texture and stimulate collagen formation,\u201d explains Plum, \u201cwhich is important because we stop producing our natural collagen after the age of 25.\u201d She adds that the vampire facial is also a great remedy for \u201cacne or surgical scars because it breaks up scar tissue bands and stimulates deeper healing.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe procedure is safe for all skin types,\u201d says Plum, but \u201cI would not recommend it to someone who has difficulties getting their blood drawn.\u201d The perfect candidate would be someone \u201clooking to improve the overall appearance of his or her skin and address deeper collagen formation.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before the vampire facial, photographs are taken to ensure there\u2019s accurate documentation of results and progress. Then \u201cthe patient is numbed for 30\u201345 minutes with a cream that goes on the skin,\u201d explains Plum. \u201cWhen the patient is numbing, we obtain about 11mL of blood, which is then spun in a centrifuge to separate the PRP from the red blood cells.\u201d Once the skin has been prepared appropriately, the microneedling begins.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The entire procedure takes roughly an hour and a half. \u201cYou don\u2019t wash the PRP off your face until the next morning,\u201d explains Plum, as this \u201callows the PRP to continue to heal the skin.\u201d You\u2019ll notice a healthy glow after the first few days, but \u201ccomplete results take about 4-6 weeks once full collagen remodeling has taken place,\u201d Plum says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After rinsing off the PRP 12\u201324 hours following the procedure, Plum advises patients to use a gentle cleanser and follow up with a broad-spectrum SPF moisturizer to protect the skin. She recommends \u201cusing a hyaluronic serum to maintain skin hydration during the following two to five days after treatment,\u201d and notes that patients can resume their normal skin care routine one week following the procedure. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Michaela Meehan is a social media strategist, writer, yogi, dog lover and music enthusiast.

And with so much variety, it could be easy to forget what the main purpose should be for your day and night beauty routines. So to break it down, we spoke to dermatologist Debra Jaliman, M.D., dermatologist and author of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin Rules,\u00a0</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to explain the proper differences between your daily skin care routine and nighttime routine and to tell you what you need to get started.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The primary focus of your daily skin care routine is protection. \u201cThe main goals of a daytime skin routine is to block the skin from the sun and UV damage,\u201d Jaliman explains, along with any other bacteria formed by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/air-pollution-effects-inflammaging/\">environmental pollutants</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<br>\n</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>With those factors in mind, here are some great products to kick off your daytime regimen:\u00a0</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThis cleanser by \u00c9minence contains <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">salicylic acid and lactic acid</a> to unclog pores and get rid of bacteria,\u201d says Jaliman. Ingredients like tea tree oil and cucumber juice work to prevent breakouts and provide a cooling effect.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As previously mentioned, the main goal for your daytime regimen should be protecting your skin from the sun. \u201cUV damage will age your skin\u2014causing lines, uneven discoloration, brown spots and broken blood vessels,\u201d says Jaliman. This sunscreen by ELTA MD contains niacinamide, which has a calming effect on acne-prone skin, so those who are afraid of breaking out should feel at ease slathering this on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having two different cleansers for morning and night sounds unnecessary, but Jaliman says it\u2019s good to mix it up. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a\u00a0salicylic acid\u2013based cleanser in the morning to unclog pores and avoid acne and a glycolic acid\u2013based cleanser at night to exfoliate your skin and get rid of dead skin cells,\u201d notes Jailman. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using a cleanser with glycolic acid can help stimulate collagen growth and because of its exfoliating texture, it will help break off layers of dead skin cells, revealing a smoother complexion. This gel cleanser is right on target with its alpha hydroxy acids to help wash away your skin cells and promote cellular generation. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The great thing about this serum is that it has retinol along with hyaluronic acid, explains Jaliman. \u201cSince retinol is drying, hyaluronic acid will help lock in moisture\u00a0to keep skin hydrated and balanced.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To finish off your PM routine, you\u2019ll want to use a product that will help your skin repair itself from pollutants and other aggressors that it could have encountered during the day. This moisturizer </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">has a formula of evening primrose oil and emollient silicones that strengthen the skin, making it less sensitive to environmental aggressors.</span></p>"},

While most vitamins are found in food, vitamin D is produced by the body itself with proper sun exposure. It then converts to a powerful hormone, calcitriol, that can positively impact bone health and calcium levels. And it doesn\u2019t stop there: New research also shows that sufficient <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23112909\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vitamin D levels can keep dry skin and eczema at bay</a>, along with a laundry list of other health benefits (from <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170523084302.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improved fertility</a> to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">better immune function</a>).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s increasingly clear that getting that vitamin D fix does a body good. But here\u2019s the catch-22: While exposing your bare skin to sunlight is a surefire way to ramp up vitamin D levels, doing so could heighten your <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-does-skin-cancer-look-like/\">risk of skin cancer</a> and premature skin aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So how can you strike a happy\u2014and safe\u2014medium? Follow these savvy tips and tricks for getting your vitamin D levels up to speed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While some studies suggest that liberal application of\u00a0sunscreen prohibits the body\u2019s production of vitamin D (because UVB rays are what kick-start the process inside the body),\u00a0most dermatologists are still <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-sunscreens-and-spf-work/\">adamant about the use of sunscreen</a> to protect yourself from the cancer-causing consequences of sun exposure. Instead of skipping sunscreen, some\u00a0recommend\u00a05 to 10 minutes of unprotected sun exposure a few\u00a0times per week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThat\u2019s all you need to maintain healthy vitamin-D levels,\u201d says Laguna Beach-based, board-certified dermatologist Bobby Awadalla. \u201cAnything beyond that could cause excessive sun damage.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But while Awadalla provides a good general guideline, finding an effective approach isn\u2019t necessarily one size fits all. Factors like skin type and location can help determine a more exact formula for how much time in the sun is enough. For instance, fair-skinned types produce vitamin D more easily than those with dark skin, so they require a fraction of the time needed to soak in the sun\u2019s UVB rays. Geography also plays a role. The closer you live to the equator, the easier it is to produce vitamin D from sun exposure. Good news for Floridians\u2014not so much for Canadians.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To figure out what works best for you, Vitamin D Council suggests another approach: Get only half the amount of sun exposure it takes for your skin to turn pink and begin to burn. This could be just 15 minutes for a very fair skinned person, yet a couple of hours or more for a dark-skinned person.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though it\u2019s virtually impossible to get all your necessary vitamin D via nutrition, eating vitamin D\u2013rich foods can play a significant role. Foods high in vitamin D are eggs, beef liver and fatty fish (like salmon and tuna) as well as fortified milks, cereals and other foods.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because the amount of vitamin D a person receives from the sun is inconsistent and increases the risk of skin cancer, some experts recommend\u00a0getting your supply of vitamin D from oral supplements. But how much vitamin D should you really take?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Based on currently available scientific evidence that supports a key role of calcium and vitamin D in skeletal health, the IOM Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Supplements also don\u2019t necessarily have to be oral. Topical vitamin D creams have also made their way onto shelves. Along with their use as a psoriasis treatment, vitamin-D creams are now being used to address <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Here+Comes+The+Sun_68056.htm\">vitamin-D deficiency</a>, in light of recent research showing their safety and effectiveness. In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976443/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2014 study</a> published by the International Journal of Biomedical Sciences, participants applied a cream delivering 5,000 IU of vitamin D to their skin daily for a period of three months; at the trial\u2019s end, their average vitamin D level had risen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Featuring ingredients\u00a0like\u00a0shiitake mushroom,\u00a0a natural source of vitamin D, and antioxidant-rich Alpine rose,\u00a0this multitasking formula nourishes and defends your skin against damaging free radicals as it provides continuous, long-lasting hydration. Use after cleansing as a toner, or spritz throughout the day to refresh and rehydrate skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Brandt Power Dose D harvests the power of the sun to bring you a potent formula that mimics the effects of skin-loving vitamin D. The weightless oil absorbs into skin, delivering an instant boost of radiance with a unique formula that improves your skin\u2019s barrier function.

We had it as kids, some of us still do. The cause for this is likely Keratosis Pilaris (KP). Resultant from a buildup of keratin, the hard protein the skin produces, Dr. Gilbert notes this</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> common skin condition</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a variant of eczema. She says, \u201cIt occurs in different forms at different ages.

While harmless, Dr. Gilbert advises that the condition may be made more severe due to weather. \u201cBecause your skin gets a bit drier in the winter,\u201d Gilbert says, \u201cKeratosis pilaris can get rougher and bumpier.\u201d Due to the red areas around your hair follicles, \u201cthe red dots can become more visible in the summer months because you\u2019re hotter and more often flushed.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Deal: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moisturizing is key in treating KP. Dr. Gilbert recommends products that incorporate an ingredient to break up the keratin.

Use once or twice daily to smooth the skin out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Folliculitis is an inflammation of the hair follicle, which can result in red bumps, tender boils and whiteheads. There are two types: what Dr. Gilbert calls \u201cinfectious and noninfectious.\u201d There are multiple causes for this condition including bacterial, yeast and candida infections (aka infectious folliculitis), as well as physical irritation like razor burn, ingrown hairs or hair follicle blockage by heavy moisturizers (noninfectious folliculitis).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Symptoms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Upon closer inspection, the sore red bumps associated with folliculitis may be white-headed pimples. These spots are located around the hair follicles and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can be quite itchy. Mild cases may clear up on their own, but severe infections can spread and require immediate treatment. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Deal:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Dr. Gilbert advises seeing a dermatologist to determine what type of folliculitis you have. They may take a sample from the area to differentiate between the different types and prescribe the right treatment. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the condition is physical (and on the spectrum of acne), use benzoyl peroxide or a topical acne medication. For bacterial folliculitis, your doctor will likely treat with an antibiotic cleanser, and may prescribe topical or oral antibiotics. For yeast or candida infections, topical anti-fungal creams; other times oral anti-fungal medications are prescribed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acne is the <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/stats/conditions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most common skin condition in the US</a>. Caused by clogged pores and bacteria, these blemishes are often located in areas of the body that produce a lot of oil and sweat, which can include the shoulders and upper arms. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Symptoms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are various types of acne, whiteheads and blackheads, as well as inflamed acne, which can appear as raised red bumps that are tender to the touch. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Deal:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Depending on your type of acne, different treatments are available from topical to oral medications. Many cleansers and exfoliators are designed to minimize and treat breakouts. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bug bites are a common skin woe that can also cause major anxiety (as treatment may require a full house cleaning). From scabies that are transferred from skin-to-skin contact, to bedbugs that live in your furniture, these red bumps are not-so-friendly gifts from your insect neighbors. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Symptoms:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Bites can appear in a linear pattern and are extremely itchy. With bedbugs, Dr. Gilbert points to the \u201cbreakfast, lunch and dinner sign,\u201d with one larger bite, then each successive bite being smaller and smaller, as the bug has gotten full during its flesh feast. (You\u2019re itching all over right now, aren\u2019t you?) </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Deal: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steroid cream will help with the itching. Getting rid of bedbugs involves changing your mattress and having a professional treat your apartment or house. Scabies infestations require a skin-specific prescription full-body treatment using </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">permethrin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cream that kills the organisms. You cover your whole body in the cream and sleep with it on. Afterward, clean your sheets and follow any specific steps for ridding your space of your pest. </span></p>"},

Starting in mid-August, I committed to no alcohol for 30 days. One Sunday night, I toasted with my last drink for the next month\u2014a Ballast Point Watermelon Dorado. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid bias, I didn\u2019t consciously change any other aspects of my routine during this month. I kept my sleeping habits, diet, water consumption, coffee consumption and skin care routine the same. That way, I could directly attribute any changes to the lack of alcohol.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Full disclosure: I can\u2019t see much of a difference between the two photos. I even considered scrapping the article altogether and pretending it never happened. Laughing at the fact that I accidentally wore the same dress on both days, I started showing the photos to a couple of coworkers, friends and my parents. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though subtle, the differences are there. Zoomed in, I could see that the dark circles under my eyes did look a little less pronounced. The crow\u2019s feet I didn\u2019t realize I had look slightly less obvious. And my skin does seem to have a bit of a glow to it in the second picture.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I didn\u2019t expect anything crazy dramatic, so I wasn\u2019t super disappointed with the results. And, while the pictures don\u2019t really speak for themselves, I feel like I learned a bit about myself and how my body responds to alcohol.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saying \u201cno\u201d to a glass of wine after work was no big deal, but when everyone around me was having a drink, it wasn\u2019t always easy to resist\u2014especially when the drinks were free (which happened on quite a few occasions this summer). </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To put things in perspective, here are the various social events (during which I\u2019d normally have a drink or two) that fell during these 30 days: </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got really annoyed with myself for how many times I said, \u201cI\u2019m not drinking right now.\u201d And it was hard to miss out on a couple of events because I didn\u2019t want to be the only one not participating. But the world kept turning, so I guess it all worked out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t really know how much I spend on alcohol in an average month. A bottle of wine here and there, a couple of beers while out to dinner with friends, a margarita on a special occasion. Regardless of the amount, I must have saved at least </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">money by not buying any alcohol, so let\u2019s call it a win.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019ll admit; I don\u2019t own a scale, so this one\u2019s a bit of a stretch. I kept getting asked if my clothes were fitting differently or if I noticed any changes in my weight or appearance, but I can\u2019t say that I did. Drinking alcohol means consuming a bunch of empty calories, so it would make sense that you\u2019d see some positive weight changes by cutting out the excess. However, instead of craving a glass of wine after a stressful day, I found myself looking for a new vice. I craved chocolate and ice cream more often than before, so I may have just been canceling out the calories with more frequent desserts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I know that alcohol can affect the quality of sleep you get during the night, and drinking at night can also mean staying up later than you would have without alcohol. However, I can\u2019t say that I noticed a huge difference overall. I\u2019ve never been a morning person, so I wasn\u2019t suddenly waking up with a new pep in my step. But I did find myself going to bed a little earlier than normal, so I was likely getting more sleep each night, at least.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Was I slightly underwhelmed by this experiment? Yes. Do I feel like my body appreciated the break? Yes. Would I do it again? Maybe\u2014but with less pressure on myself. I don\u2019t drink heavily to begin with, and when I do consume alcohol, I tend to stick with red wine (which has some great health benefits from <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/antioxidants-for-skin-care/\">antioxidants</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_The-Uses-and-Benefits-of-Reservatrol_1931.htm\">resveratrol</a>).

Because cold sores aren\u2019t exactly easy to hide, having one can make you feel very much alone. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not fun in the slightest bit, they\u2019re actually a lot more common than you\u2019d think. Somewhere around <a href=\"http://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">90 percent of us will have at least one cold sore in our lifetime</a>, with 40 percent of us suffering from recurrent cold sores. They\u2019re so prevalent because they spread from person to person very easily.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides being extremely contagious, cold sores can be painful, uncomfortable and utterly embarrassing. We talked to clinical aesthetician Jennifer Gerace at Jason Emer, MD in Beverly Hills to learn a bit more about these blisters and get tips on how to get rid of a cold sore, fast.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold sores, also known as fever blisters, are caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). \u201cThis virus is passed from person to person by saliva (either directly or by drinking from the same glass or cup) or by direct skin contact,\u201d says Gerace. Cold sores can be obvious or ambiguous but usually appear as clusters of tiny blisters on the lip. \u201cThese blisters can start as small red patches that are itchy, or you can experience the same symptoms as a cold sore without any skin changes,\u201d Gerace explains. The HSV virus lives in your nervous system and is dormant the majority of the time. However, certain triggers can bring it out of its dormancy. These triggers include sunlight, extreme temperatures, stress, menstruation and injury to the skin (such as a chemical peel, microneedling, a facial or lasers).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to get rid of a cold sore overnight. They will usually go away by themselves <a href=\"http://www.umm.edu/health/medical/altmed/condition/herpes-simplex-virus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">within two or three weeks</a>. However, you may be able to shorten that time (and ease your discomfort) through medical or natural treatments.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gerace says antiviral medications such as Zovirax, Famvir, Valtrex and Abreva are standard when it comes to treating cold sores. \u201cAntiviral drugs work best when you start taking them early, even before blisters develop.\u201d If using medication doesn\u2019t appeal to you, you may be able to find relief through over-the-counter topical treatments (more on those below).\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One ingredient, in particular, to look out for when scanning for treatments is lysine. \u201cOne of the best vitamins for cold sores, lysine suppresses arginine, an element that helps viral cells reproduce,\u201d says Gerace. \u201cThus, taking lysine internally or in the form of a topical ointment can be helpful in reducing herpes simplex cell production.\u201d Gerace also mentions specific foods you can eat that are rich in lysine like wild-caught fish, chicken, beans, brewer\u2019s yeast, mung bean sprouts and most fruits and vegetables.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Other options include <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16813459\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">supplementing with vitamin E</a> to soothe skin, relieve pain and discomfort and repair damaged skin. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/13678235\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">p</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eppermint oil has natural, antiviral properties to aid in healing, and is said to be a great natural alternative to medicated treatments.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eating immune-boosting foods like yogurt, apple cider vinegar, kimchi and sauerkraut strengthens the immune system naturally. These foods are rich in probiotics, which are essential components <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4006993/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">when it comes to maintaining your immunity</a>.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking a vitamin C supplement or consuming foods that are rich in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16373990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vitamin C also supports the immune system</a> by keeping your cells healthy.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0You can also take a lysine supplement regularly and apply sunscreen to keep HSV from rearing its ugly head. Other than supplementing and eating an immune-boosting diet, <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/dermatologists-share-tips-for-treating-cold-sores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keeping your stress level down is crucial to cold sore prevention</a>.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are experiencing repetitive cold sore outbreaks, a physician will be able to prescribe you antiviral medication to ease these episodes. Although there are many natural ways to treat and prevent cold sores, <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/dermatologists-share-tips-for-treating-cold-sores\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stress, hormonal changes and illness</a> can wake up the virus, resulting in those troublesome fever blisters.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A self-proclaimed wellness junkie, Jessica Gomes is a freelance writer and health enthusiast who currently resides in Los Angeles, California.

Rogers \u00b7 October 9, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have all been given well-intended advice by a friend or family member that sometimes ends up doing more harm than good. In my practice as a dermatologist, I\u2019ve heard my fair share of these from my clients. Here, I debunk a few of the most common skin myths, as well as share my best tips and advice on what you should do instead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it\u2019s wrong:</strong> An <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-spf-50/\">SPF of 50</a> means you can stay in the sun 50 times longer than you could without it before burning. But it does not take into account that the sunscreen starts to break down as soon as it is applied to the skin. No matter the SPF, you still need to reapply every two to three hours when outside enjoying the sun. Furthermore, SPF only describes protection from UVB rays, the sunburn rays that also damage your skin\u2019s DNA. UVA rays penetrate the skin more deeply, causing wrinkles and brown.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What to do instead:</strong> Instead of looking for a product with the highest SPF, look for a product with an SPF of 30 that is also labeled with UVA and UVB protection or broad spectrum. The best, broadest protection comes from <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-sunscreen-alternatives/\">zinc oxide</a>. It used to make you look like a clown but the formulations have come a long way! I use a 15% zinc-based sunscreen every day.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it\u2019s wrong:</strong> The truth is, even though it feels really good to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-pop-a-pimple/\">pop a pimple</a>, a lot can go wrong when we start picking. We often pick too much, re-creating a bigger wound for our body to heal. And when we squeeze, we can push some of the pus deeper into the skin, causing more inflammation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it\u2019s wrong:\u00a0</strong>No, no, no! There is no such thing as a healthy tan. Tanning is the skin\u2019s response to injury from the sun\u2019s radiation. It only starts to tan AFTER the skin cell identifies damage to its DNA to try to protect your skin cells from further injury. Data shows that tanning bed users are 75% more likely to develop melanoma, 150% more likely to develop basal cell carcinoma and 250% more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What to do instead: </strong>Embrace your skin tone, or find your favorite self-tanner to model under a poolside umbrella. I\u2019m a fan of the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_SelfTan+Towelette++Half+Body_9513.htm\">TanTowel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Gradual+Tan+Everyday+Body+Lotion_36458.htm\">St. Tropez Everyday Body Lotion</a>.</p>"},

You know exactly which ones we\u2019re talking about: The kind where you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s a breakout or a reaction to a new cleanser, where you immediately drag out your laptop and search for \u201ctiny bumps on face,\u201d hoping for an image that matches (and, ideally, explains what they are). Not all bumps are created equal, but you can identify them based on\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their color, size and other symptoms (like itchiness). From there, you can find the most effective way to treat them, bringing you one step closer to making them disappear altogether. Dermatologist Michele J. Farber, MD, FAAD at <a href=\"https://www.schweigerderm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schweiger Dermatology Group</a> in NYC helps us identify some of the most common bumps.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anything from small red bumps to whiteheads to large, painful cysts. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breakouts</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be both inflammatory and noninflammatory. \u201cInflammatory lesions include red papules, pustules and deeper cysts, and noninflammatory lesions are blackheads and whiteheads,\u201d says Dr. Farber</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It\u2019s Happening:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everything from menstruation to not washing your face at night can lead to acne. \u201cAcne is caused by hormonal factors and changes in sebum production, as well as inflammation and bacteria in the skin,\u201d explains Dr. Farber.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal With It:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best acne treatment depends on the severity, but the best tends to be a multi-pronged approach, including topical lotions and creams and, if it\u2019s rampant, oral options like birth control. \u201cExtractions, injections, peels and lasers can be helpful in the office to help clear skin as well,\u201d says Dr. Farber. Whatever you do, don\u2019t pick at it, since you run the risk of scarring.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve been using acne-fighting products since high school and still get breakouts, see your derm. Treating acne sooner can help prevent acne scars and can help improve your skin faster.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> Tiny white bumps beneath your skin, occasionally around your eye area.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It\u2019s Happening:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Milia are usually caused by rubbing or occlusive creams,\u201d says Dr. Farber. \u201cThey can also follow trauma or be induced by blisters.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal With It:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They\u2019re easy to prevent with topical exfoliants, so look for products that have retinol or glycolic acid</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Once the milia are already there, though, it\u2019s not a DIY situation. \u201cThey\u2019re deeper under the surface than they look and require special tools to remove safely, so don\u2019t squeeze them at home,\u201d says Dr. Farber.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want your milia removed, they can either be easily extracted in your derm\u2019s office or via laser, which works well if you have a lot. But they\u2019re benign, so there\u2019s no harm in having them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Healthy moles have defining features: A uniform brown color, well-defined borders, overall symmetry, and clock in under six\u00a0millimeters. They can be either flat or raised\u2014either is totally fine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It\u2019s Happening:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blame both the sun and your genes. Sun exposure causes moles, and genetic factors can dictate whether you have a few or too many to count. \u201cMoles are collections of melanocytes, or pigment-producing cells within the upper layers of the skin,\u201d says Dr. Farber. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal With It:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless it\u2019s irritating or you just don\u2019t like how it looks, you don\u2019t have to remove a healthy mole. But if you decide you want to do it, that\u2019s a job for your derm. To prevent them from multiplying\u2014and, in general, keep your skin safe\u2014wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen every day. (Dermstore recommends\u00a0the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Mineral+Tinted+Creme+SPF+30+Broad+Spectrum+UVAUVB+Sunscreen_43930.htm\">Mineral Tinted Cream SPF 30</a> by MDSolarSciences)<br>\n</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should go at least once a year for a skin exam to check your moles no matter what, even if they look normal to you. Healthy moles can be cut out with either an excision, in which your doctor cuts a small area around the mole and sutures the area closed, or with a shave removal, which entails a special blade to cut around the mole on a superficial level. If you notice a mole changing in any way, make an appointment stat. \u201cConcerning features are the ABCDEs of melanoma, which are <strong>A</strong>symmetry, <strong>B</strong>order irregularity, multiple <strong>C</strong>olors, <strong>D</strong>iameter over six millimeters and <strong>E</strong>volution over time,\u201d says Dr. Farber.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What It Looks Like:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Red, rough bumps, sometimes on the cheeks but most commonly on the back of your arms, the front of your thighs and on your buttocks.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It\u2019s Happening:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s just a harmless\u2014though annoying\u2014skin condition. \u201cIt\u2019s very common and seen in almost half of all people,\u201d says Dr. Farber. \u201cPeople with eczema and dry skin are more predisposed to keratosis pilaris.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal With It:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trick is to keep your skin as smooth as possible, so double up with moisturizing formulas and gentle exfoliants. Dr. Farber recommends looking for ingredients like urea and certain alpha hydroxy acids, which can help shed the bumps.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0You could also try certain retinoid prescription creams. Whatever you do, don\u2019t pick the bumps. It\u2019ll just irritate the keratosis pilaris and make matters worse.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If keratosis pilaris drives you crazy or seems to be getting worse, you can visit your doctor to explore your treatment options.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What It Looks Like:\u00a0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bumps (or even rashes) that are red and itchy. If it\u2019s a bad allergic reaction, you may notice oozing or blister-like bumps\u2014but, besides severe itchiness, there shouldn\u2019t be any pain.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why It\u2019s Happening:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When physical or chemical agents, like acids, in harsh soaps damage the skin\u2019s barrier, they can cause skin irritation. An allergic reaction, on the other hand, is an actual immune response to certain ingredients, like fragrances or preservatives.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal With It:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stop using whatever it is that caused the reaction and get an over-the-counter cortisone cream. \u201cSteroid creams can treat more limited eruptions, and antihistamines are also extremely helpful for itch,\u201d says Dr. Farber. She also recommends washing up with lukewarm water (even in the shower) and gentle soaps, since hot water may exacerbate irritation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good idea to visit your dermatologist anytime this happens, since it\u2019s so easily treatable. But make an appointment ASAP (or even go to urgent care) if the reaction covers a large area of the body, pain, blistering or lesions in the mouth or groin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deanna Pai is a freelance beauty writer in New York, NY.

And with a </span><a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/facelift/cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">price tag</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of an average $7,048, it\u2019s the most costly but also the only truly long-lasting option. Because nonsurgical treatments can\u2019t achieve the same results as this permanent option can, facelifts are for those looking for the optimal outcome; although, Dr. Buka adds it is recommended only after all other nonsurgical options have been taken.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for a non-surgical procedure? A facelift sure isn\u2019t the only player in the game! Dr. Buka recommends Ultherapy. \u201cI like Ultherapy because it\u2019s a secret weapon for lifting the skin on the neck and fixing tired-looking skin underneath the eyes,\u201d adding that it takes around 30-45 minutes and the cost ranges from $1,500 to $3,000. The secret weapon? It works by using a focused radio-frequency and ultrasound to send energy to different layers of the skin while stimulating collagen deep within, rejuvenating a youthful appearance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all too often neglect the neck area even after so carefully caring for our face and hands, and yet the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skin around the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">neck is even more fragile. Dr. Chaboki explains that patients are often using nonsurgical treatments such as Botox and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-to-know-before-cosmetic-surgery/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">facial-filler injections</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to enhance their appearance, especially so to maintain the upkeep of a facelift. And the statistics support this. The <a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/press-releases/new-plastic-surgery-statistics-reveal-focus-on-face-and-fat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Society of Plastic Surgeons </a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reports</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that in 2016, injection-based procedures that target specific areas such as under the chin increased 18% while non-invasive skin-tightening procedures that tighten sagging areas increased 5%.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Summertime, vacation, weekend\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter\u2014we want our physique at a personal best. But life often just gets in the way\u2014and that\u2019s okay! \u201cOur collagen and elastin gets tired of picking up our tissue for all those years, and it eventually starts to sag,\u201d relates Dr. Buka while Dr. Chaboli adds that loose skin can develop on the body after childbirth, weight loss or bariatric (like gastric bypass) surgery. Unfortunately, after such times in our lives, the skin doesn\u2019t bounce back to normal which is why both experts recommend plastic surgery such as a </span><a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/tummy-tuck\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tummy\u00a0</span></a><a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/tummy-tuck\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tuck</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">arm lift</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to remove the excess skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the above doesn\u2019t apply to you, you may just need to get a little physical!

It starts with a focus on skin health: regular exfoliation, hydration, drink water, etc. \u201cThis trend is about caring for your skin until it strobes on its own and you don\u2019t need foundation and primers to fake it,\u201d says Alex LaMarsh, celebrity hair and makeup artist. \u201cIt approaches skin care as an indulgent experience rather than a duty.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other words, mastering \u201cglass\u201d or dewy skin starts with self-care. Ready to embrace your skin\u2019s beauty from the inside-out? Here\u2019s how you can get dewy skin that shines even in the coldest winter days. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The key to looking fresh-faced starts with, well, a fresh face. Begin your skincare routine with a clean slate. Remove any leftover makeup along with dirt and oils that have settled in your pores over the course of the day or night. Choose a product that is not drying, but instead hydrating so that your skin is retains enough moisture to withstand any makeup you apply along with the wear and tear of the outside environment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: </b><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Hydrabio+H2O_72253.htm\"><b>Bioderma Hydrabio H2O</b></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIn traditional Korean skincare regimens toner is applied by vigorously patting into the skin,\u201d explains Rodriguez. \u201cThe belief is that the skin is stimulated increasing circulation, which helps to create a healthy glow.\u201d To maintain optimal hydration, opt for a toner that\u2019s infused with antioxidants and essential fatty acids, so your skin is left smooth and vibrant.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is not the step to skip, experts say, if the look you\u2019re going for is glowing and dewy. \u201cExfoliation is critical to get that dewy look,\u201d says Hilary Kline, a Minneapolis-based makeup artist. \u201cIn fact, it helps buff away those dead layers of skin and helps reveal a brighter complexion.\u201d Choose a hydrating scrub that incorporates a rich blend of organic botanicals like jojoba beads, aloe vera and olive oil, as well as powerful antioxidants that limit the production of skin-damaging free radicals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A rich dose of hyaluronic acid, whether in a serum or face oil, is the boost of hydration your skin is craving. It not only keeps your skin supple and prevent dryness, but it also provides the perfect foundation for you to apply your makeup. \u201cHyaluronic acid is like a sponge that pulls in water to the outer skin layer,\u201d says Joshua Zeichner, MD, director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. \u201cIt enhances hydration, radiance, and offers a plumping effect.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To acquire that dewy, glowing skin, experts recommend choosing a moisturizer that sinks right into the skin, leaving it supple and soft, but not oily. \u201cYou want to have highly moisturized skin, but not look greasy,\u201d explains LaMarsh. \u201cMoisturizers that are too slick can make makeup slide across the face rather than settle on the skin.\u201d Again, choose a product that contains hyaluronic acid to lock in that moisture for intense hydration that lasts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To prepare the complexion for makeup application, apply a face primer that nourishes and hydrates the skin. This will not only lock in moisture, but it will plump the skin and aid in maintaining that healthy glow throughout the day. \u00a0Remember this look is all about buffed away pores and a healthy bright dewy face,\u201d adds LaMarsh. \u201cSo make sure your primers don\u2019t take away from that.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: </b><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_First+Light+Priming+Filter_70080.htm\"><b>Becca Cosmetics First Light Priming Filter</b></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI always say you need to make sure your makeup is working for you, so use a product that is more like a an anti-aging hydrating moisturizer with medium to full coverage added into it,\u201d says LaMarsh. She recommends a densely packed foundation buffing tool, like the Beauty Blender, to help apply and buff the concentration directly into the skin in light circular motions all across your face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: </b><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Custom+Cover+Drops_65192.htm#headingDetails\"><b>COVER FX Custom Cover Drops</b></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Highlighters softly reflect and diffuse light, which experts say is an important aspect of the look. \u201cEmphasize the highlighter on the high points of the face, i.e. tops of cheekbones, to achieve the most effective style,\u201d says Rodriguez. \u201cRemember the look is all about an overall, sheer luminous quality so nothing should look too heavy.\u201d To achieve the super glossy \u2018glass skin\u2019 dewy look, he recommends mixing a little highlighter with your foundation and/or applying some finishing touches with the highlighter at the very end.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: </b><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Living+Luminizer_39895.htm\"><b>RMS Beauty Living Luminizer</b></a></p>"},

She gave us some juicy insight into eyebrow evolution and how much those two little arches actually do.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our eyebrows define our faces and our means of communication, but they also serve a much more physical and significant purpose\u2014they protect our eyes.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cEyebrows are my thing,\u201d Cahill excitedly tells us. \u201cAnd our eyebrows\u2019 main function is really to prevent sweat and water from entering the eye.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The natural arch of the \u201coriginal/unkept\u201d eyebrow is to divert sweat and water. Eyebrows are there to ultimately direct moisture to the side of the face to keep our eye area dry.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cOur eyebrows also prevent dirt/debris/dust/etc. from entering the eye,\u201d says Cahill. \u201cBut they also act as a landmark, seeing as human faces are relatively flat.\u201d\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This plays a significant role in facial identity. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to our fingerprints, everyone has a different eyebrow shape. So the \u201clandmark\u201d that is our unique eyebrows can contribute to specialized facial recognition algorithms used most commonly among law enforcement agencies, but can now even be used to unlock your new mobile device.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eyebrows can do a lot expressively in addition to the hard work they do in protecting our eyes and aiding in twenty-first-century technology. Cahill tells us simply that our brows\u2019 main esthetic purpose is to aid in expression.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAn easy example would be translating a single raised eyebrow as a sign of skepticism,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they also assist in full-blown communication as well.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cahill says communication with our eyebrows is especially important in the deaf community as facial expression can actually alter the meaning of a hand sign. It can also dictate the mood the person is in in relation to their signing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However we choose to style our brows can do a number of things to the appearance of our faces. This includes our methods of design and maintenance. Cahill says <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/different-eyebrow-shapes/\">our preferred style of brow</a> can do as much as lift, elongate, shorten, close off, fill, soften, frame and ultimately \u201ccomplete\u201d our faces.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of ways to maintain our eyebrows, including tweezing/plucking, waxing, sugaring, laser hair removal, electrolysis, threading, shaving, depilatory creams and medications.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Cahill adds that there are also a number of ways to \u201cdesign\u201d our brows, including eyebrow extensions, microblading, tattooing (micropigmentation), tinting, pencil, pomade, powder, gel and wax.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The focus on eyebrow shapes dates all the way back to 2500 BC, says Cahill, where <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/history-of-makeup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Egyptian men and women wore heavy makeup</a> to define and enhance their looks. Their brows needed to be equally as prominent as their heavily lined eye.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFast forward to 146BC and the ancient Greeks emphasized a more natural approach,\u201d says Cahill. \u201cMarried women had natural brows while unmarried women would touch up their brows with black incense.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was even a time when a unibrow was considered a desirable characteristic, as it was a sign of intelligence.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, during the Elizabethan Era, Cahill says there were only two types of eyebrows: perfectly arched, fine lines or completely removed eyebrows (yikes!).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eyebrows of the last century transformed to pencil thin and heavily plucked in the 1920s. \u201cThe brow style has changed almost every decade,\u201d adds Cahill. \u201cThe thirties transitioned to dark thin lines, and in the forties brows began to become thicker with a more prominent arch.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elizabeth Taylor was a model for pristine brows in the fifties with a strong arch and powerful coloration as well as Marilyn Monroe in the sixties.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe seventies was the time when eyebrows returned to their natural shape and then barely plucking them at all in the eighties,\u201d says Cahill. \u201cThe nineties was just a melting pot of everything. People started taking an individualistic approach instead of doing what everyone else was doing.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last seventeen years have introduced brow fillers and a more clearly defined makeup palette for eyebrows. \u201cWe\u2019ve almost circled back to the eighties,\u201d Cahill adds, \u201cbut with much more product to work with as eyebrows have returned to really accentuating fullness and depth.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Megan Kiger is a writer, a worrier and an infamous sleeper.

After all, add up the minutes and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ve probably spent hours (if not days!) shaving your legs. And between the nicks and the ingrown hairs, dealing with your body hair can feel like a battle. But it doesn\u2019t have to be\u2014especially once you learn more about it. Here\u2019s what you should know.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone who\u2019s groomed her bikini line knows that it\u2019s a hotspot for ingrown hairs. It happens for two reasons. First, \u201cthe hairs there may be curlier than underarm or leg hair, so when they start growing, they may curve back under the skin instead of coming straight out,\u201d says </span><a href=\"http://artofdermatology.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jessica Krant, MD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a dermatologic surgeon at the Laser &amp; Skin Surgery Center of New York in NYC. Secondly, your bikini line endures constant friction and pressure from clothing, which can keep the hairs from growing straight out (as they should) and force it back into skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of safety, the best way to shave your underarm hair is in the direction of hair growth \u2014 and for most people, that\u2019s in an upward direction. But most people have their own preferences and, for the most part, that\u2019s totally fine. \u201cShaving against the hair growth makes it easier to get a smooth result, but has an increased risk of ingrown hairs,\u201d explains Dr. Krant. If ingrowns are a regular issue for you, try swiping your underarms post-shave with </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Ingrown+Eliminating+Pads+_27609.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bliss Ingrown Eliminating Pads</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nicks are annoying, but that\u2019s mostly it. No matter where it is, you can treat it like you would any other cut. \u201cRinse it fully and keep pressure on it for several seconds to a few minutes to make sure it\u2019s not actively bleeding,\u201d advises Krant. If it\u2019s a deeper nick or in a sensitive area, dab a little petroleum jelly on it and top it with a bandage until it heals.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can skip the body scrub when you\u2019re planning to shave your legs. \u201cShaving does exfoliate skin because the blade scrapes off outer layers as you go,\u201d says Dr. Krant. \u201cBut it\u2019s important to be gentle with this.\u201d If you\u2019re too razor-happy, you risk over-exfoliating, which can cause dryness and irritation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Body hair is normal, and it exists for an evolutionary reason: To keep us warm. But too much of a good thing can be a sign that something else is going on in your body. \u201cIf you feel you have more hair than normal on your mustache area, chin, chest, or stomach\u2014along with irregular periods and trouble managing weight\u2014it could be worth seeing your gynecologist,\u201d says Krant. These signs point to a hormonal condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome, which definitely requires a visit to the doctor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knew? There\u2019s a reason that the hair on your arms is much finer than, say, your pubic hair. \u201cIn the underarm and bikini area, the sweat glands are called apocrine,\u201d explains Dr. Krant. \u201cThey produce odor.\u201d (So </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019s why your underarms smell if you forget to apply antiperspirant.) Aprocrine glands have an abundance of hair follicles, which is why underarm hair can grow so thick. As for the rest of your body hair, the hair is rooted in eccrine sweat glands, which primarily control temperature. Hair follicles are more dispersed here, so it\u2019s much finer.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s just an old wives\u2019 tale that shaving changes the thickness or growth rate of body hair. \u201cShaving just cuts thicker, mature hairs in the middle of the hair shaft and allows the same hair to keep growing,\u201d explains Dr. Krant. \u201cThe hair that grows now has a blunt tip from being cut off, so overall the hair seems bulkier and darker.\u201d When you\u2019re waxing, on the other hand, you\u2019re pulling out the hair at the root, so a new hair begins growing in its place. This baby hair is thinner and softer\u2014at first. But over time, it\u2019ll be just as thick and dark as what you\u2019re shaving.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More women are embracing their body hair, and with it have come products formulated to condition and nourish it. Skip them, says Dr. Krant. You don\u2019t need to condition your body hair, since the oils on your skin will do it for you.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deanna Pai is a freelance beauty writer in New York, NY.

Salicylic acid peels are your new best friend. While not technically magic (but cleverly close), the bread and butter of these nourishing peels lies in the active ingredient: salicylic acid.

From indulging in an olive oil\u2013infused bath to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-make-teeth-whiter/\">whitening your teeth</a> right at home, experts give their best suggestions for what to do with that extra hour this season.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With just a few tools, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makeup, hair and male grooming expert</span> <a href=\"http://www.thesophiaporter.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Porter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says you can save on hiring an esthetician to clean your face and give yourself a facial instead. Porter explains that the benefit of this deep cleansing ritual is how it primes your pores to better absorb products, leaving you with a brighter and softer complexion. To begin, use a facial steamer, like\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Pro+Facial+Steamer_68631.htm\">Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare Pro Facial Steamer</a>, for ten minutes to loosen any dirt or oil that\u2019s trapped in your skin.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Next, exfoliate your skin to remove any dead skin from the surface. While there are plenty of exfoliants available, Porter recommends paying close attention to the ingredients, with a superstar in mind: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">glycolic acid</a>. \u201cThis is a fantastic ingredient to incorporate into any routine,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s also wonderful to lessen the appearance of any dark spots on the skin.\u201d Try </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Miracle+Plus+Pads++30_70798.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cane + Austin Miracle Pads + 30%</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to scrub away one layer to reveal another.

However, if you don\u2019t have the time to take off from work to recover from this procedure, or the extra cash, Zeichner says you can reap similar rewards with an at-home process like </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AgeDefying+Laser+Antioxidant+System_65166.htm?keyword=tria\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SkinCeuticals\u2019 Age-Defying Laser + Antioxidant System</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though you can begin with your hour-long gift from daylight savings day, Zeichner says to remember that lasers need time to take effect. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lasers create microscopic damage to the skin and take advantage of wound-healing properties to create new collagen,\u201d he explains. \u201cThis translates to healthier skin with more even tone and texture. Antioxidants further improve skin pigmentation and enhance production of healthy collagen.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admit it: sometimes you wish you could get a haircut or a blowout merely for the massage in the washing chair. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hairstylist and makeup artist</span> <a href=\"http://www.julesannen.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jules Annen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains that this soothing effect of having someone touch your head is caused by engaging acupuncture points. You can re-create these feel-good sensations yourself with just a little time and flexibility. To begin, shampoo your hair as you normally would. Then, apply a scalp oil, like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Revitalizing+Hair+and+Scalp+Tonic_31074.htm\">Dr. Hauschka Revitalizing Hair &amp; Scalp Tonic</a></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cApply pressure</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to your bai hui point (also known as paihui) at the center of the top of the head. To find it, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">draw an imaginary line from your nose up. Stop when it crosses the extension top of the ear on either side,\u201d she explains. \u201cMassage with the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rollerball or with your fingertips on the point with vertical pressure for five to ten minutes. Remember to be gentle as to not damage your hair.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to cleaning your hair, Annen says you\u2019ll also experience relieved muscle tension, improved lymphatic drainage and venous circulation, stimulated nerve pathways and an abundance of happy hormones. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between maintaining and connecting your friendships to exceeding up the corporate ladder and working out, those days of playing might feel long ago.

Protein is only produced when there are sufficient amino acids present. Amino acids are what many experts have deemed the \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d of the body.

According to Marino, amino acids are responsible for pretty much every chemical reaction in our bodies.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acids that must come from our diet. There are nine essential amino acids and they are </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tryptophan and valine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Acids produced by our bodies, including alanine, asparagine, aspartate and glutamine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">T</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hose that can usually be produced by the body except under specific health-related circumstances (such as auto-immune deficiencies, stress, young/old age) and they include arginine, cystine, tyrosine, glycine, ornithine, proline and serine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marino says our bodies must have protein in order to produce new muscle tissue and connective tissue. \u201cOur body runs on protein,\u201d she says, \u201cso amino acids are responsible for muscle growth, but it\u2019s important to remember you cannot enter into the world of fitness and expect results without a healthy diet.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutritionally speaking, meats, dairy products, eggs, legumes, nuts and cereals are particularly high in protein, but Marino says as long as we\u2019re eating whole foods, we\u2019re at least partially restocking our protein supplies. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSince all of our proteins are made up of just 20 amino acids, the differences between the thousands of unique proteins are simply in the sequence of those amino acids,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe have specialized molecules that know which amino acids to put together in what order to make a certain protein.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marino took a second to describe each one of our cells as a picky Wolfgang Puck\u2014they must have every amino acid needed, every ingredient present, before it will even think about starting to make a protein. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLet\u2019s just say, our cells are smart and can improvise and convert some amino acids into others if they are missing an \u2018ingredient,\u2019\u201d she tells us. \u201cHowever, the nine essential amino acids must be eaten, and when you combine foods, like beans and rice or pasta and cheese, you do get all of the essential amino acids. And it\u2019s extremely important that you do!\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only are amino acids vital to maintaining our physique and keeping a healthy diet\u2014they also contribute to benefits for our hair, skin and nails.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Marino explains that because the amino acid, methionine, can build connective networks\u2014it supports the strength and structure of our hair. Methionine is an essential amino acid and can be found in meats, nuts, beans and dairy products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arginine and Glutamine also support cell growth and renewal when it comes to skin, but Marino says glycine, leucine and proline are all directly involved in collagen production, hydration and many anti-aging skin concerns. \u201cCollagen is a protein, and we need amino acids to build protein,\u201d says Marino. \u201cThey can only offer immeasurable benefits.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSimilarly to our hair, arginine opens that passageway for our blood, creating healthier circulation and support to the root,\u201d says Marino. \u201cThis all comes back to protein.

Why the plateau? While our collective quest to unlock all the secrets to anti-aging is still very much on, exciting and effective non-surgical facelift options are now available for those hesitant to go under the knife.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We spoke with NYC-based esthetician Nichelle\u00a0Temple, owner of\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://inderma.studio/the-ultimate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inderma\u00a0Studio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who specializes in\u00a0micro-current\u00a0facials. She took us through some in-office treatments to help achieve a facelift without surgery. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A facelift, Temple explains, is \u201ca surgical procedure where the surgeon makes small incisions throughout the hairline, behind\u00a0the ears,\u00a0chin and mouth to then pull the skin back to decrease the appearance of aging.\u201d While the results of this procedure can be dramatic, they are not permanent. Over time, she warns, sagging and wrinkles will return\u2014hence the decision for many to seek non-surgical options. Let\u2019s explore some of these alternatives.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also known as dermal </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fillers, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">injections help to fill in the appearance of lines and wrinkles. They can also plump up the skin, giving a more youthful look and reducing any sagging or hollowness. As Temple explains, \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fillers such a\u00a0Juv\u00e9derm\u00a0are packed with hyaluronic acid, which adds volume to desired areas of the face in order to lift cheeks, smooth parentheses lines or plump the lips.\u201d The results, she notes, are both subtle and\u00a0long-lasting. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultherapy uses ultrasound technology and is the only FDA-cleared, non-invasive procedure that lifts, tones, and tightens the skin. As a practitioner, Temple appreciates the precision of the method, that it allows her \u201cto see the layers of tissue targeted during the treatment to ensure the energy is deposited where it will be most beneficial.\u201d The treatment can be highly effective, she says, \u201cjump-starting a natural process to produce fresh, new collagen.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commonly described as \u201cfacial toning,\u201d micro-current is Temple\u2019s specialty at Inderma Studio. It is her preferred procedure for non-surgical facelifts, she says, \u201cdue to the dramatic lifting effect that\u00a0micro-current\u00a0has on facial muscles and facial contours.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microcurrent instantly plumps out deep lines and wrinkles, promoting skin healing as well as collagen and elastin production. During the procedure, all 32 facial muscles are \u201cphysically manipulated using soft cotton tipped wands (probes) that transmit the mild electrical impulses.\u201d The treatment is pain-free, she adds, and offers instant gratification. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This procedure is brand-new and Temple is already a fan. Cryolift, she explains, \u201cdelivers hyaluronic acid and CO2 to the skin directly, lowering the skin\u2019s temperature, causing surface blood to rush (true oxygenation) and wrapping the contracting and expanding pores around the hyaluronic acid.\u201d It treats dehydration and reduces inflammation, giving an overall glow. Ideal for all skin types, she notes, there is zero downtime and instant results.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collagen-producing\u00a0lasers penetrate the skin deeply, at the layer of restructuring. They work, Temple explains, by gently heating the collagen under the surface of the skin. This expands the collagen, tightens the skin and shrinks broken capillaries. In her experience, this method has less of an impact than other treatments. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NuFACE Trinity Facial Toning Kit is a handheld, micro-current device that contours the face and reduces wrinkles with five minutes of daily use. Temple recommends it for \u201cat-home treatment in between professional services\u201d as it won\u2019t give the full effects of an in-office procedure. \u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face-Lift-In-A-Bag comprises cooling gels designed to mimic injectables. Utilizing Icelandic glacial water, the treatment rejuvenates the area around the eyes, forehead and lips, while antioxidants shield against free radicals and shea butter and jojoba hydrate the skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Regular use of a lifting serum, Temple says, can enhance hydration in the skin and give a younger-looking complexion. In this serum, the centella asiatica works to boost collagen production and the algae improves firmness. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This cream calms and moisturizes the skin, diminishing wrinkles, improving texture and providing long-term, anti-aging benefits. Stimulating ingredients work to promote firmness and lift sagging skin. </span></p>"},

Botox isn\u2019t the only solution. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhile it gives the most dramatic response to brow furrows [frown lines], it should not be the only treatment for the problem,\u201d says cosmetic physician Stanley Kovak, MD, of </span><a href=\"https://www.drkovaklaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kovak Dermatology &amp; Laser Institute</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, commenting on alternatives to Botox. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find out how to get rid of frown lines with some less invasive options,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> read on.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI find that the most dramatic effect is with the use of a filler,\u201d says Dr. Kovak, recommending a hyaluronic filler such as Restylane or Juvederm. According to the Cosmetic Surgery National Data Bank Statistics, these specific injectables saw a 16% increase in 2016. \u201cThese fillers immediately improve the furrows or linear depression, but I have also seen renewed collagen growth in the treated area.\u201d What does that mean for you? Long-term improvement of those pesky frown lines with filler treatments.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s true that chemical peels are great for at-home treatments to rejuvenate the skin but in-office chemical peels contain higher amounts of active ingredients, meaning </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4554394/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">they go deeper into the skin to target wrinkles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and improve skin laxity. This, in turn, leaves you with softer, smoother skin. Dr. Kovak explains </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that frown lines are caused by many factors such as excessive sun exposure, age and dynamic muscle movement. So even though you may slather on the SPF, frown lines can still appear in time. The bottom line being, one of the best non-invasive ways to get rid of frown lines is to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">see a dermatologist for a professional chemical peel.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upping your skincare regimen by adding anti-aging products prolongs the results of in-office treatments but can also be used to take preventative measures against frown lines. \u201cDaily skin care from hyaluronic acid and vitamin C, to retinol and sunscreen, helps prevent sun damage, stops the causes of aging and even reverses some of the signs of aging,\u201d explains Dr. Kovak.

This includes rolling 200 microneedles over our face to improve collagen production, promote skin regeneration and more. The name of this practice, you ask? <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-microneedling/\">Microneedling, aka derma-rolling</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMicroneedling is a collagen induction therapy [that] promotes skin rejuvenation,\u201d says <a href=\"http://drjaliman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, board-certified dermatologist and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Rules-Trade-Secrets-Dermatologist/dp/1250025109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skin Rules: Trade Secrets From a Top New York Dermatologist</a></em>. \u201cNeedles are used to create small punctures on the top layer of the skin which [signal] the body to create new collagen and elastin,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In case you missed it: collagen and elastin are two proteins that act as the building blocks for the skin\u2019s overall structure. That said, as we get older, our collagen and elastin production starts to slow down and fine lines, wrinkles and sagging skin start to appear. For this reason, Dr. Jaliman recommends patients try microneedling to improve the firmness of their skin, as well as the texture and overall appearance of large pores. \u201cIt can also be beneficial for acne scars,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you can book an appointment with a specialist for an in-office microneedling session\u2014you can also practice the anti-aging technique at home. To do so, Dr. Jaliman recommends purchasing a derma-roller with needles that are at the very most 0.3 mm thick and performing the treatment once every two weeks. Curious to know more? We tried the celebrity-approved treatment for six weeks and share our experience up ahead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to microneedling, we love <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_ORA_503809.htm?keyword=ora\">ORA</a> for all of its at-home treatment devices and tools. As we previously mentioned, when selecting a derma-roller, Dr. Jaliman suggests going with one that is 0.3 mm or less\u2014especially if it\u2019s your first time. For this at-home experiment, we chose the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Microneedle+Face+Roller+System+025mm++WhiteAqua_63690.htm\">ORA Microneedle Face Roller System</a>, which has a needle depth of 0.25 mm.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With ultra-tiny needles, the derma-roller glides over the complexion, creating micro punctures in the skin that signal the dermis to produce collagen and elastin. As a result, the skin regenerates itself for a plumper, smoother and firmer surface. Not to mention: using the Face Roller System can also help fade scars, increase absorption of skin care products, blur the look of stretch marks and can even be used on the scalp to prevent hair loss.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get started, you\u2019ll first need to prep your skin. Begin with a cleanser <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cleansers+and+Exfoliators_503724.htm?keyword=cleansers%20and%20exfoliators\">and end with a gentle exfoliator</a> or peel. Once your skin is prepped, it\u2019s time to apply a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyaluronic+Acid_500277.htm?keyword=hyaluronic%20acid\">hyaluronic acid</a> (HA)-based serum. Using a serum with a hydrating ingredient (such as HA) can help maximize the effects of at-home microneedling and prevent an adverse reaction.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Start by applying two layers of the serum to your complexion. You can do this all over or work in zones (adding serum in between each area you go over with your derma-roller). Next, glide the derma-roller across each area of your face vertically, horizontally and diagonally, repeating each direction twice. Then apply a third layer of serum for added hydration and comfort.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you\u2019re finished microneedling, be sure to apply some rubbing alcohol over the roller to clean the device. Then, store the derma-roller in its plastic case for safe keeping. In addition to cleaning and storing your derma-roller, you may want to keep track of how often you use it, as it\u2019s best to replace the device after every 10-15 uses. Priced at $20, this at-home treatment is a much more affordable alternative compared to an in-office visit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As someone with skin on the youthful side of the spectrum, I was honestly not expecting much from my microneedling experiment. Sure, maybe the treatment would help exfoliate my skin, but what ended up happening was so much more. As previously mentioned, I decided to try microneedling for a total of six weeks. So, with Dr. Jaliman\u2019s recommendation of performing the at-home treatment once every two weeks, that meant a total of three treatments. Note: though I noticed that my skin felt a little sensitive afterward, I didn\u2019t experience any pain throughout this experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>After the First Treatment: </strong>One would think that three microneedling treatments aren\u2019t enough to see results, but it\u2019s actually quite the opposite. After the first go-around, I noticed that my skin (which is usually dry) felt softer and the skin care products I used post-treatment (another layer of serum and my night cream) soaked into my complexion quicker than usual. Not to mention: in the days that followed, I saw a change in the overall clarity of my complexion\u2014my skin was glowing!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>After the Second Treatment: </strong>While the glow didn\u2019t last longer than a few days, my soft skin did. During the second treatment, I paid close attention to the more sensitive areas, such as my under-eyes and lips. I tend to get puffy under-eye bags easily and read that the treatment can help drain some of those fluids. And while I didn\u2019t notice a difference immediately afterward, my skin felt a little tighter and less swollen in the days to come.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>After the Third Treatment: </strong>By now my complexion held onto its softness and I did start to notice a longer-lasting change in clarity and glow factor. My under-eye bags came back (as they do), so I decided to focus on them again. If I decided to continue with this treatment, I imagine I\u2019ll have to carefully go over my under-eyes every time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the final treatment, my skin felt so soft and smooth. I also noticed a gradual change in the firmness of my complexion (it was nothing crazy, but it definitely felt tighter!) and so long as I quenched my skin with nourishing serums and moisturizers, my skin held its glow much longer than the first time around. For that, I think this is one at-home treatment I\u2019ll keep up with.</p>"},

For anything more severe, you should see a doctor for treatment (which goes for chemical burns, too, which typically require medical attention). </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How to tell the difference? \u201cMinor first-degree burns leave the skin pink or red but don\u2019t cause blistering, oozing or crusting,\u201d says </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jennifer Hermann, MD</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon at <a href=\"https://www.rodeoderm.com/about/our-medical-team/jennifer-hermann-md-faad/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MFC Dermatology in Beverly Hills, CA</a>. \u201cIf redness lasts more than two weeks or any crusting or blistering develops, this may be a sign of a deeper burn that needs attention.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve gotten sunburned, your best bet for treating it is a cool compress paired with a thick, bland emollient, such as Aquaphor. As for protecting your new sunburn from the sun, either stay in the shade or use a physical (or mineral) sunscreen. \u201cMany sunscreens, especially those that are chemical-based, may be too irritating to injured skin at this early stage of healing,\u201d explains Dr. Hermann. Dermstore suggests </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Ultimate+UV+Defense+SPF+30_1311.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SkinCeuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once it begins peeling, it\u2019s hands off. \u201cFlaking is part of the natural healing process as your body sheds the injured skin,\u201d says Dr. Hermann. \u201cI typically don\u2019t recommend patients pick or peel the skin as this can remove too many layers and cause additional injury.\u201d That injury can cause irritation or, worse, potentially increase your risk of scarring, so it\u2019s best to avoid it altogether.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for other minor burns\u2014and by minor, we mean first-degree burns or milder\u2014the treatment is similar to that of a sunburn. Immediately apply a cool compress, and then follow up with a layer of a thick, fragrance-free emollient. \u201cBecause the skin barrier is damaged, skin products with many preservatives or fragrances can be too irritating, sting and cause prolonged redness,\u201d says Dr. Hermann. She recommends protecting skin with physical sunscreen to mitigate irritation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minor burns or sunburns typically won\u2019t leave a scar, since they don\u2019t damage the deeper layers of skin. But anything more severe can\u2014and probably will\u2014create a scar, though its severity depends on the extent of damage. Dr. Hermann suggests using a scar cream as soon as the top layers of your skin have healed. \u201cMany scar creams contain silicone, which acts to hydrate the skin,\u201d she says. She\u2019s a fan of </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_DNA+Scar+Therapy_41078.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DNA EGF Renewal DNA Scar Therapy</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> since it also contains DNA enzymes, which target healing microscopically and more efficiently.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with that, Dr. Hermann recommends using a zinc-based sunscreen, which will prevent scars from hyper-pigmenting or turning brown. Scars remodel for a year, so patience is key if you\u2019re unhappy. Once it stops changing, you can explore more intensive options. \u201cIf texture changes result after the burn, we can use precise resurfacing lasers to smooth skin, and if redness persists, we can use vascular lasers to fade this away more quickly,\u201d she says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most burns can be avoided with care and, of course, ample sunscreen. But if you do happen\u00a0to find yourself on the receiving end of a minor burn or sunburn, these tricks will help alleviate the effects and fade burn scars.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deanna Pai is a freelance beauty writer in New York, NY.

We\u2019re Debunking Some of the Most Common Myths</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jessica Willingham \u00b7 November 28, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warts are one of the most common skin conditions, and they can wreak havoc on your hands, feet and more. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warts</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are bumps that form in the skin, appearing as flesh-colored, pink, light or tan-colored bumps. Some are barely raised with a smooth surface, while others can be larger with a cauliflower-like texture. You don\u2019t have to be a witch to have warts, so here are five more myths to know so you can save your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWarts are caused by the human papillomavirus or HPV,\u201d says Dr. Sue Ann Wee of </span><a href=\"https://www.schweigerderm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schweiger Dermatology Group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThere are more than 100 different types of HPV. Some HPV subtypes cause common warts whereas other subtypes can cause serious conditions such as cervical cancer.\u201d Warts are spread by skin-to-skin, skin-to-mucosa or mucosa-to-mucosa contact. Warts can spread not just person to person, but from one area of the body to another.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYes, warts can be contagious,\u201d says Dr. Wee. \u201cIndirect skin contact with contaminated objects such as shed skin containing HPV virus on gym mats and other gym equipment, shared floors, etc. The wart virus enters most often through tiny cuts or abrasions in the skin.\u201d They can even be spread by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-safe-is-your-nail-salon-7-best-nontoxic-nail-polish-brands-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">improperly cleaned nail salon equipment</a>, so be sure to ask your salon about their policies before you sit down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, warts can be removed. Because warts can require multiple treatments, some people believe they cannot be removed and give up on treating them. But, dermatologists <a href=\"https://www.schweigerderm.com/warts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have many treatment options for warts</a>\u2014such as cryotherapy (freezing the wart off) or Cantharidin (\u201clifting\u201d the wart off).\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, warts can grow back. \u201cThe HPV virus can remain dormant in host skin cells and then re-activate months, even years later,\u201d says Dr. Wee. \u201cThe best way to remove a wart is to see your dermatologist. It is most important to first make sure your lesion is accurately diagnosed. There are many skin lesions, both benign and malignant, that can mimic warts. There are many treatments that your dermatologist may discuss with you ranging from topical salicylic acid treatments to liquid nitrogen cryotherapy to immunotherapy treatments (stimulate your immune system to attack the wart virus).\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to prevent new warts from growing is to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-keep-your-skin-healthy/\">practice good skin care and skin hygiene</a> under the guidance of your dermatologist. Frequent hand washing can help prevent the spread of warts. Warts most commonly infect skin through tiny abrasions in the skin. So, healing and covering up these abrasions is an important way to help to reduce the\u00a0chance of HPV infection. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWarts can spread to nearby tissue if picked or scratched so not picking wart lesions helps, too,\u201d says Dr. Wee. \u201cWiping down keyboards, gym equipment and gym mats, and avoiding going barefoot in public places can be helpful as well. Sometimes, warts grow in hair-bearing areas like the beard area, and good razor hygiene is necessary to prevent re-exposure and spread of the warts. Although it is possible to reduce the chance of getting a wart, it is not always possible to prevent warts as the wart virus is quite ubiquitous and most people will come into contact with the HPV virus.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jessica Willingham is a copywriter for creatives and brands.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/loss-of-skin-pigmentation/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">6 Causes of Loss of Pigmentation in Your Skin</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Chanel Hays \u00b7 December 11, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-40464 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Woman-with-glasses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"750\" height=\"620\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Noticing changes in your skin, like suddenly appearing white spots, may be worrying. And, while the Internet might offer a firm and ominous diagnosis, loss of skin pigmentation has a wide variety of causes, mostly benign and unknown. Loss of skin pigment ranges from patchy and passing to solid and permanent. We\u2019re talking about more than a fading tan, and <a href=\"https://curology.com/medical-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Lortscher</a>, Board-certified dermatologist and CEO of Curology, is a true source of knowledge on the subject. Use his insight below as a reference to help you consult your dermatologist for final diagnosis and treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An injury to the skin, from simply picking a blemish or a significant burn, may cause enough damage to form a white scar (hypopigment). \u201cIf the damage is enough to partially, or completely, destroy melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) in the area, a scar with decreased pigmentation may result,\u201d says Lortscher. To prevent further injury, fight the urge to touch your wounds and let them heal. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> There are several topical prescriptions that possibly help with re-pigmentation of white scars, but Dr. Lortscher does not expect them to have highly noticeable improvement. Care for wounds during the healing process with a scar treatment or oil to help repair the skin, conceal with a tailored product or aim to lighten your overall skin tone to decrease contrast.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some skin conditions resulting in pigment loss don\u2019t have a known cause. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitiligo is a pigmentation disorder affecting 0.5\u20131% of the population, in which melanocytes (the cells that make pigment) in the skin are destroyed by the body\u2019s immune cells,\u201d says Lortscher. \u201cAs a result, white patches appear on the skin in different parts of the body. Most people are otherwise healthy, although there is for some patients a greater risk of autoimmune diseases, including thyroid disease and diabetes.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> Unfortunately, treatments to date have not had predictable results because, as Lortscher explains, \u201cthe chance of re-pigmentation is greatest for newer patches, and for vitiligo on the face and body; however, hands, feet and areas with white hair respond poorly.\u201d Current treatments range from topical creams, light therapy, oral steroids and antibiotics, and even surgical skin grafts, but all come with serious risk and side effects.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pityriasis alba is a common skin condition affecting mainly children and young adults and is thought to be related to eczema. With this condition, \u201cround or oval, slightly scaly pink patches appear, leaving pale marks when the redness has faded,\u201d says Lortscher. \u201cPityriasis alba patches are more apparent in summer, especially in darker skin, because they don\u2019t tan as well as the surrounding skin.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> Pityriasis alba is one of the few hypopigmentation conditions with only temporary pigment loss. \u201cA moisturizer will improve any flakiness; a topical 1% hydrocortisone ointment may be used for a limited time for redness or itching, but should not be continued long-term. However, treatment will not change the lighter pigment\u2014this will gradually improve over months as the skin renews itself,\u201d says Lortscher.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever notice what appear to be white freckles on your arms and legs? \u201cIdiopathic guttate hypomelanosis (IGH) is a common harmless disorder of adults characterized by small, well-defined, round, white, flat spots on the sun-exposed areas of the legs and forearms. The patches are usually asymptomatic and can resemble vitiligo,\u201d explains Lortscher. Interestingly, women are more likely to have IGH, but it\u2019s another condition in which the cause is unknown. Contributing factors may include genetics, sun exposure, trauma and autoimmunity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> \u201cTreatment is not necessary but is sometimes requested by patients. Although multiple methods have been tried, including superficial dermabrasion, cryotherapy (freezing), topical retinoids and topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, results have been variable,\u201d says Lortscher. Even though IGH hasn\u2019t been proven to be caused by sun exposure, it is always beneficial to apply daily sunscreen for prevention of many skin conditions.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone has a small amount of fungus living on their skin. Unfortunately for some, it overgrows in times of increased moisture, like humidity or sweating. \u201cTinea versicolor causes flaky discolored patches on the chest and back, neck and/or arms, but is uncommon on other parts of the body,\u201d says Lortscher. The color is not necessarily white or pale, it can also present as coppery-brown or pink.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> \u201cAnti-fungal products containing\u00a0active ingredients such as selenium sulfide, ketoconazole or pyrithione zinc will usually keep tinea versicolor under control,\u201d says Lortscher. \u201cSusceptible people tend to get recurrences, so maintenance therapy once or twice a month, especially during warm and humid periods, is typically smart. At times, in resistant cases, an oral anti-fungal pill may be prescribed for a short time period.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Irregular moles trigger cause for concern, but in the case of a halo mole it\u2019s most often benign. \u201cA halo mole (or halo nevus) is a mole with a white ring, or halo, around it, and is usually seen in children or young adults,\u201d says Lortscher. \u201cFor unknown reasons, the body\u2019s immune system attacks the pigment cells in the mole. Some of the reaction affects the normal skin around the mole, which also has pigment cells in it, causing the white halo.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Best Treatment Option:</strong> Because moles can be problematic, anyone with a halo mole should have a full skin examination to check for vitiligo or melanoma, since it could be a sign of a greater condition. Lortscher says, \u201cAs these are almost always completely benign, removal of a halo nevus is usually unnecessary unless the nevus itself has atypical features. It\u2019s important in this case to see a dermatologist for an evaluation and an accurate diagnosis.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chanel Hays left a six-figure corporate job to start her own media and marketing company for small businesses.

So imagine our excitement to have their team here at the Dermstore HQ for a brand training that included <em>the</em>\u00a0world-class Natura Bisse facial!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just a quick background: Natura Bisse is a family-owned luxury skin care line founded in Barcelona, Spain. What makes this brand truly stand out\u2014aside from the fact that you can only find this brand in high-end beauty counters and luxury spas and hotels all over the world\u2014is that it doesn\u2019t rely on fancy packaging and massive social media presence. It\u2019s mostly known for its elegant formulas, which fuse extraordinarily high concentrations of active ingredients with pioneering delivery systems to serve up results you can actually see. But of course this kind of claim doesn\u2019t mean much unless you\u2019ve actually experienced those results yourself. So when an opportunity to try the Natura Bisse facial treatment here in the office presented itself, I was one of the first to volunteer!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As soon as I stepped into our makeshift spa room, I was immediately transported to a different world. All it took was a dim room, a comfortable bed, a few candles, silence and the heavenly scent of Natura Bisse products\u2014things I could easily find in my own house! </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think everyone should know how easy it is to do your own facial at home, and that you don\u2019t necessarily need a lot of time and high-tech tools,\u201d esthetician and Natura Bisse Trainer Ashley Degenford said. \u201cIn just 10 minutes you can get a great pick-me-up from a peel. If you have more time and want to relax you can add a mask; there are so many options.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natura Bisse believes that everyone\u2019s skin is unique and has its own voice. And even though facial regimens typically follow the same sequence,Degenford stressed the importance of tailoring your facial treatment based on your skin type and concern. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since my skin is usually dry and occasionally dull, she recommended skin care ingredients that promote hydration and illuminate the complexion, like vitamin C and shea butter.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have dry skin like mine, below are the steps she took to treat my skin. (Keep scrolling down to find her suggested regimen for oily/combination, sensitive/redness-prone, acne-prone, hyperpigmented and mature skin types.)</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Degenford, all facials start with a thorough cleanse. \u201cCleansing removes daily oil, dirt, makeup and environmental pollutants. You never want to start a facial without cleansing; your products need clean skin to absorb fully and do their work.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For this step, she massaged the\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_The+Cure+AllInOne+Cleanser_73325.htm\">Natura Bisse\u00a0The Cure All-In-One Cleanser</a>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">onto my dry (not wet) skin with her dry hands\u2014something I would never think of doing. Then she added a few drops of water, which turned the cleanser into a milky emulsion. She massaged my skin a few seconds more,\u00a0then removed the cleanser with a wet washcloth. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter your skin type, Degenford recommended toning after cleansing to remove any residue left from cleansing and to help prepare your skin for exfoliation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Tip: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Natura Bisse facials do not use steam or hot towels. That\u2019s because their team believes that heat is inflammatory to the skin. Use cool-to-lukewarm water for rinsing and cleansing instead.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After toning, Degenford applied a thin even layer of </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Tolerance+Enzyme+Peel_73335.htm\">Tolerance Enzyme Peel</a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to my face, neck and d\u00e9collet\u00e9. \u201cExfoliation is key for removing dead skin cells that can accumulate on skin\u2019s surface,\u201d she explained. Regular exfoliation has a multitude of benefits: you immediately see brighter, clearer skin, and over time you notice more even tone, less visible fine lines and wrinkles; it also prevents blackheads.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One thing that sets Natura Bisse exfoliants apart is that its professional-strength peels are gentle enough that they can be safely done at home with no redness or downtime. If you\u2019re doing this at home, let the product rest on the skin for three to five minutes. Massage for a few minutes before removing the product with water.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was perhaps the most relaxing part of my treatment. Aside from the rhythmic movement of her hand against my skin, the delicious, citrus scent of vitamin C almost lulled me to sleep. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI always recommended massaging a cream onto skin before applying the mask,\u201d explained Degenford. \u201cIt\u2019s because most of our masks are designed as finishing masks and will help the active ingredients of previously applied products penetrate further. For the most relaxing results, take your time massaging until the cream is completely absorbed.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For skin that\u2019s in need of serious hydration and a brightening boost, this mask is a godsend, delivering a heady dose of antioxidants, vitamins C and E, as well as shea butter. \u201cMasks are a great way to deliver a more concentrated dose of active ingredients to skin,\u201d said Degenford. \u201cThey are the best way to target specific concerns and provide the benefits of a spa facial at home.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She let the mask rest on my skin for 10 to 15 minutes and then removed it with water. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Degenford recommends: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">balance and purify oilier skin types, try Oxygen &amp; Cure collections, which feature glycerin and hyaluronic acid to give lightweight hydration without heaviness. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Step 1: </b>Cleanse With\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_The+Cure+AllInOne+Cleanser_73325.htm\">The Cure All-In-One Cleanser</a><b><br>\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apply to dry skin with dry hands, massage and remove with water or washcloth.

Beyond the common sunburn, there are a number of conditions that result in uncomfortable or painful areas of your skin. And they may not be what you expect. We caught up with Dr. Jeremy Fenton of </span><a href=\"https://www.schweigerderm.com/jeremy-fenton-m-d/)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Schweiger Dermatology Group</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in New York City to discover why skin sometimes hurts, what causes it and when to see your doctor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What It Is:</strong> \u201cIt is a chronic pain condition with tenderness in certain characteristic areas, like your skin,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. \u201cSymptoms also include stiffness, fatigue and difficulty concentrating. It can also be accompanied by a wide variety of other symptoms such as anxiety or depression.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Causes It:</strong> In short: no one really knows. \u201cIt is a diagnosis of exclusion: all other possible causes for the symptoms need to first be ruled out; without any other explanation, fibromyalgia can be made as the diagnosis.\u201d This is not a condition generally diagnosed by your derm. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How to Treat It:</strong> \u201cThere are a variety of treatment options including medications such as pain\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">medications, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications and anticonvulsants,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. \u201cPeople also utilize behavioral and psychological therapy methods.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What It Is:</strong> \u201cSunburn is a result of excessive exposure to ultraviolet light. It causes redness, pain, tenderness, sometimes blistering, and peeling,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Causes It:</strong> \u201cThe ultraviolet light causes damage to the skin cells, which then release inflammatory signals and some undergo programmed cell death.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How to Treat It:</strong> \u201cSunburns are usually treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications like ibuprofen or aspirin and cool baths or showers for symptomatic relief,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. \u201cIt is important to stay well-hydrated with a sunburn because there can be some fluid loss, and severe sunburns may require IV fluids and prescription pain medications. Some topical emollients such as aloe vera can help with symptom relief but do not necessarily speed recovery.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What It Is:</strong> Shingles is caused by the chicken-pox virus, so if you\u2019ve had the chicken pox or have been vaccinated, you already have the virus in your nervous system. Shingles, like the pox, appears as a scabbing, irritation or series of itchy red spots on the skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Causes It:</strong> \u201cWhen somebody gets run down, sick or overly stressed, the virus can re-emerge along one of the sensory nerves,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. \u201cIt generally only appears along one nerve and thus is on just one side of the body in what we call a \u201cdermatome.\u201d It can cause nerve pain and increased sensitivity in the area along with redness and swelling that progresses into blisters and scabbing. It can sometimes lead to scarring and infection.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How to Treat It:</strong> \u201cShingles is treated with antiviral medications such as valacyclovir or acyclovir for at least a week. The pain can be treated with prescription pain medications\u00a0but is most commonly treated with medications that treat neuropathic pain such as gabapentin. These modulate the nerve signals to reduce the pain transmission. Shingles can also be treated with anti-inflammatory topical or oral steroids, but the benefit of these is debated and must be weighed against the risks.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What It Is:</strong> \u201cNeuropathy is a very general term referring to dysfunction of a nerve. This can lead to numbness, weakness or discomfort,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Causes It:</strong> \u201cThere are a wide variety of causes of neuropathy including diabetes, vitamin deficiency, toxicity from exposure to chemicals including alcohol, autoimmune conditions, chronic disease, trauma or tumors.\u201d A neurologist is best to make the diagnosis, likely using tools like X-rays and MRIs, along with nerve function tests and a physical exam.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How to Treat It:</strong> A dermatologist wouldn\u2019t diagnose or treat this condition. Medications or surgery could improve symptoms.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What It Is:</strong> \u201cMigraines are recurrent headaches that can be accompanied by nausea and vomiting along with sensitivity to light and sound,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. Most people who experience migraines have at least one instance of skin sensitivity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What Causes It:</strong> We aren\u2019t sure. It might be a combination of environmental and genetic factors, so see a neurologist if your headaches persist. \u201cIt is not entirely understood why some people get migraines and others don\u2019t,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>How to Treat It:</strong> \u201cThere are a variety of medications used to manage and prevent\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migraines, including NSAIDs, pain medications, antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and even\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Botox injections,\u201d says Dr. Fenton. Your local derm may be able to help with the latter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we hope this blog helps, it\u2019s not meant to diagnose your symptoms. Dr. Fenton says that while some of these conditions can be treated by seeing a dermatologist, your first stop should be your primary care physician.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> See your doctor if:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Jessica Willingham is a copywriter for creatives and brands.

Whether your sensitive skin is characterized by reactivity to certain ingredients in terms of oil production, breakouts or sudden dryness, it\u2019s not something you want to challenge. Believe it or not, face oils can actually do quite a bit of a good\u2014even for the most sensitive skin. To help sell you on the idea of massaging oil into your face like it\u2019s a ritual, we consulted NYC Dermatologist, Dr. Sejal Shah, founder of <a href=\"http://www.smarterskindermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SmarterSkin Dermatology</a>. By the end of this article, you\u2019ll be wrestling over which bottle of skin-rejuvenating goodness to add to your sensitive skin care routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While face oils are widely marketed toward all skin types, it\u2019s the right oil or the specific combination of oils that can be particularly beneficial for sensitive skin. \u201cFace oils are rich in fatty acids, antioxidants and other essential nutrients that make repairing the skin barrier and locking in hydration possible,\u201d Dr. Shah says. What\u2019s more, they can give the skin an instantaneous silkiness and superficial hydration that\u2019s known for <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-get-dewy-skin-without-makeup/\">today\u2019s must-have dewy skin look</a>. At last, the secret to model-off-duty skin!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with any skin care product, it\u2019s important to consider your specific skin concerns when choosing a face oil. When it comes to sensitive skin, Dr. Shah recommends looking for oils that are rich in fatty acids to reinforce the skin barrier, antioxidants to protect and combat future damage, and anti-inflammatory ingredients to soothe. Not sure where that leaves you? Think <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/avocado-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">avocado oil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/marula-oil-beauty-benefits/\">marula oil</a>, chia seed oil and sunflower oil, just to name a few.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond the ingredients, you\u2019ll want to think about texture and scents. \u201cIf you have acne-prone, oily or combination skin (which can still be sensitive), you will want to use lighter, drier oils or oils with astringent effects, while heavier oils are better for dry skin,\u201d Dr. Shah says. From there, consider your reactivity to fragrances. If you\u2019re not sure where your skin lies, play it safe and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/wrinkles-acne-or-itchy-scalp-theres-a-beauty-oil-for-that/\">use caution with fragrant and essential oils</a>, as they can sometimes aggravate sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending on your sensitive skin\u2019s specific needs, your face oil will soon join the ranks of your AM or PM skin care routine\u2014or both. Dr. Shah points out that oils are best used at night since they tend to leave a shiny visage which could potentially interfere with daytime makeup, however if you have dry skin it may be beneficial to use an oil during the day as well. At the end of the day, it really comes down to personal preference, but it\u2019s important to remember that face oils are meant to be an addition to your skin care routine, not a one-stop solution for everything. \u201cKeep in mind that face oils lack other essential ingredients for the skin, such as hydration-boosting humectants and rich blends of emollients,\u201d says Dr. Shah. \u201cIt\u2019s these ingredients that provide skin with deep and long-lasting moisture, so you don\u2019t want to cut them from your routine in favor of a face oil,\u201d explains Dr. Shah. So, when it comes to applying your soon-to-be-favorite face oil, simply add a drop or two into your moisturizer, or follow up your first step of hydration with a few drops dabbed on top.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you know more about face oils and, more important, their effects on sensitive skin, you might be feeling a bit intrigued. Before heading blindly down the skin care aisle, you may want to brief yourself on the industry\u2019s most effective face oils for your sensitive skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to find your perfect match?

What\u2019s the worst that could happen? You show up late for work? Have a terrible hangover? Try again: We\u2019re talking about blisters. They\u2019re unsightly and painful. But fear not\u2014these fluid-filled bubbles are treatable (and preventable!). We answer your burning questions on how to treat a blister, below.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board-certified dermatologist, </span><a href=\"http://mohs-md.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maral K. Skelsey</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explains that blisters form when fluid, either clear or yellow-tinged, accumulates in a space between the layers of the skin. The liquid acts as a cushion to the wound, so your body is simply taking protective measures. There are chiefly two types:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most </span><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blisters/treatment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">blisters heal naturally</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, simply because new skin grows underneath the blister and your body reabsorbs the fluid until the skin on top dries and peels off. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be exact, Dr. Skelsey says you can expect to wait seven to 10 days. In the meantime, she explains how to treat a blister at home to speed recovery:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because blisters heal on their own, you should treat it and leave it. \u201cMost blisters do not need to be drained unless they are very tense and painful,\u201d says Skelsey. So, no to self-surgery!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can\u2019t resist popping the blister, or as it sometimes happens, it bursts on its own, here are the doctor\u2019s orders: \u201cIn that case, thoroughly clean a needle and the skin with alcohol and gently pierce the blister so that the fluid is released,\u201d Skelsey details. \u201cDo not remove the roof of the blister as it will help the healing process. Apply petroleum jelly or other ointment and a loose bandage.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it\u2019s from yard work, exercise or too much walking, blisters happen. If they regularly plague you</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he </span><a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/skin-hair-nails/injured-skin/blisters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Academy of Dermatology Association</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> informs us how to prevent them:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That warm sensation is called a hot spot, your body\u2019s way of telling you a blister is about to form.

It\u2019s also important to head to the doctor\u2019s office if the blister keeps coming back, if several blisters have appeared for no reason or if the blister was </span><a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/blisters/#when-to-see-your-gp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">caused by a burn or an allergic reaction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-do-scar-creams-work/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">How Do Scar Creams Work? Plus, 6 Recommendations</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jessica Griffiths \u00b7 December 21, 2017</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are various causes of scarring, but the frustration that comes from a scar\u2019s stubbornness to go away is singular. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With countless products and treatment options claiming to reduce scarring, we wanted to find out </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">if scar creams really work. We spoke with board-certified dermatologist\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.eringilbertmd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Erin Gilbert, MD, PhD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find out the efficacy of scar creams and other methods for minimizing the appearance of scars.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Dr. Gilbert, scars are the result of collagen fiber regrowth after a skin injury. \u201cMost superficial injuries\u201d she says, \u201cwill lead to temporary changes in the color of the skin (red or white depending on your skin type), whereas deeper injuries can lead to depressed scars (as in acne), raised scars or flat, shiny scars (as in deeper burn scars).\u201d The majority of scars, regardless of cause, will change color and fade naturally with time, but specific treatments and products may be required to significantly reduce their appearance. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Dr. Gilbert shares, research in scar reduction \u201chas shown that silicone is the most effective ingredient in reducing the appearance of scars.\u201d This is because silicone can reduce collagen overgrowth, which leads to scarring. Silicone also works to flatten and fade scars by hydrating the tissue. Other ingredients to look for are vitamin E oil and allantoin, which also soften the skin. To reduce the appearance of scars, creams and other products hydrate and smooth the area, reducing redness and evening out the skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Gilbert notes that \u201cexcellent results can be achieved\u201d with scar creams and \u201cyou will see improvement in your scar.\u201d However, total elimination is unlikely.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternative treatments for scar reduction include \u201ca procedure called \u2018subcision\u2019 where a hypodermic needle is used to loosen scar tissue beneath the skin.\u201d Dr. Gilbert also suggests, \u201cSteroid injections into the scar which can help flatten thick, overgrown scars like hypertrophic and keloid scars.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we dive into some of our most popular scar creams and treatments, remember to always protect the scarred area from the sun with sunscreen or protective clothing as, Dr. Gilbert reminds us, \u201cSun damage can impair the healing process as well as result in prolonged scar discoloration.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Apply to clean and dry, fully healed skin to effectively repair the area. These sheets create a protective layer against damage and infection. The active ingredient is silicone, which, Dr. Gilbert shares, \u201cworks by reducing collagen overgrowth and results in flatter scars.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working to reduce the intensity of scars, this product contains hyaluronic acid, which acts as a filler and helps to even out the skin. Gently rub onto the affected area once a day to improve the texture and color of the skin. It works on both new and old scars. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With reparative qualities, the gel contains allantoin, which breaks down inflamed scar tissue and helps to encourage healthy cell growth. Apply 2\u20133 times daily for maximum effect.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know your body is able to actively heal while you are sleeping? Gently massage this cream onto the skin before bed to see real results in scar reduction. Dr. Gilbert says, \u201cMassaging the skin with a scar cream or plain vitamin E oil can help soften or flatten scars.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This gel promotes cell renewal with lactic acid, which brightens and exfoliates the skin, and olive oil which improves tone and elasticity. Once the wound has healed, apply a thin layer of gel to the scar twice daily to flatten the area and reduce redness. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Microneedling, Dr. Gilbert notes, is a common treatment for scar reduction. This painless procedure creates micro punctures that promote healthy skin growth, softening the skin and fading the appearance of scars. </span></p>"},

Random rash? There\u2019s a reason for it\u2026but that can be pretty tricky to figure out. Rashes, redness and irritation are common signs of inflammation of the skin, but there are a host of factors that could be behind that inflammation. Here, what you should know about different and most common types of skin inflammation\u2014and what you can do about them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inflamed skin is irritated skin. \u201cInflamed skin typically means the skin has been irritated from an internal or external cause,\u201d says dermatologist </span><a href=\"http://nyulangone.org/doctors/1013146307/nada-elbuluk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nada Elbuluk</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, MD, assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology of NYU. It can appear in a few ways, including itching, burning and discoloration of the skin. Inflammation may look red or pink in early stages (think your average rash or pimple) and can leave behind a light- or dark-brown patch. In darker skin, that initial discoloration takes on more of a purple tone. \u201cThe degree of discoloration is often dependent on several factors, including the depth in the skin at which the inflammation is occurring and how long it\u2019s been occurring,\u201d notes Elbuluk.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of inflammation in the skin: acute and chronic. The difference between them is a matter of timing, says Elbuluk. Acute inflammation usually lasts six weeks or less and can result from many skin issues, like </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-causes-adult-acne/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">acne</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/home-remedies-sunburn/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sunburns</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and allergic reactions. Chronic inflammation goes beyond six weeks and may be indefinite. It often goes hand in hand with </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/eczema-what-is-it/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eczema</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_What-are-the-Different-Types-of-Rosacea%3F_1935.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rosacea</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-you-shoud-know-about-psoriasis/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">psoriasis</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014skin diseases that don\u2019t usually disappear in a few days or weeks.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some form of inflammation accompanies most skin diseases. What\u2019s behind those skin diseases, though, depends on the individual. \u201cRisk factors can vary for each condition but may be affected by one\u2019s genetics,\u201d explains Elbuluk. Diet and hormone levels can lead to acne, while everything from the temperature to your skincare regimen can impact eczema. Illnesses or stress may trigger psoriasis. And all of the above can cause inflammation of the skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most things, there\u2019s no obvious way to avoid skin inflammation. You can try to avoid external trauma to skin, as well as certain illnesses that may trigger it, but there are some chronic and genetic conditions that predispose you to a state of inflammation no matter what.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s good news: Regardless of the severity, you\u2019ve still got treatment options. They primarily depend on what\u2019s causing your inflammation of the skin, the severity of the condition, how long it\u2019s lasted, and how much of the body is affected by it. Anything from topical creams to light therapy to oral medications may help ease your skin inflammation. Those chronic and genetic conditions require more intensive, possibly immunosuppressive treatments\u2014and, obviously, a trip to your doctor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your inflammation of the skin comes and goes, you might already know the reason behind it. (Looking at you, hormonal acne.) But if you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suspect an internal illness\u2014or you\u2019re dealing with symptoms that don\u2019t go away after six weeks\u2014it\u2019s worth making an appointment with your derm just to be on the safe side.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deanna Pai is a freelance beauty writer in New York, NY.

While certain whiteheads can be easily treated with some TLC, more severe cases require serious techniques, and learning how to treat an infected pimple is essential epidermal education. To get all the right answers, we spoke with </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">esthetician Nichelle\u00a0Temple, owner of\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://inderma.studio/the-ultimate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inderma\u00a0Studio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in NYC.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not a pretty picture. Temple describes, \u201cAs dead skin cells and bacteria build up and fester under the pimple,\u201d the area becomes swollen and a pustule can form. A pustule is an inflamed pimple with a white or yellow center containing pus. An infected pimple is pretty rare</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it\u2019s usually self-made. With new pimples, the impulse is to poke and prod, but Temple tells us this is the cause of most infections. She says, \u201cThe more you poke and prod the pimple without proper technique and products, the more likely it is for it to become infected.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you notice a new pimple coming to town, Temple recommends \u201cusing a spot treatment with a high concentration of benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, resorcinol or sulfur.\u201d Then, she stresses, leave it alone. These ingredients are particularly effective as they help to dissolve follicular buildup. A particular favorite of Temple\u2019s is </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_The+Acne+Control+Regimen_63943.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Acne Control Regiment by PCA Skin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only time Temple suggests DIY extraction is when you notice the white pus starting to push its way out of the pimple. Then, wait to do anything until after a steamy shower. \u201cCleanse and disinfect the area thoroughly,\u201d she says, then \u201cwrap your fingers in a tissue and gently apply pressure with two fingers North/South and then East/West (top and bottom and then side by side) in a gentle rotation until the head of the pustule is out.\u201d Quickly disinfect the area with a </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Acne+Toner_9655.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">salicylic acid based toner</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and then leave it be. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep it simple: if you\u2019re suffering, you should see a doctor. If your pimple is causing a deep, throbbing under the skin, your doctor could administer a cortisone shot. They may also offer a prescription if you suffer from chronic breakouts. Another option, Temple reminds us, is to \u201cschedule an extraction-based facial or chemical-peel facial with an esthetician.\u201d \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Risks include scarring, which Temple says can be caused by \u201cfingernails, discoloration and indentation from using too much pressure.\u201d Not cleaning the area well enough after extractions (and always) can spread bacteria and cause additional pimples. Improper exfoliation should also be avoided. She warns, \u201cUnder-exfoliation can be the cause of pimples, yet over-exfoliation can over-dry the skin and then the sebaceous glands will produce more oil to make up for the lack of hydration.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The easiest prevention as Temple recommends to her clients, is to \u201cfollow a personalized skincare routine complete with twice-daily cleansing, regular exfoliation, the proper toners and serums and moisturizers.\u201d Also, seek out a knowledgeable esthetician who can provide you with an in-depth skincare analysis including what ingredients are best for your skin type and what will help you to avoid infected pimples.</span></p>"},

Yes, you heard me, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">year-round</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Protecting yourself from the sun decreases your risk of getting skin cancer and slows the signs of aging. Studies show that the sun\u2019s UV radiation causes 90% of skin aging. It\u2019s never too early to start protecting your skin and a great habit to start young.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also non-negotiable: Washing your face before bed. You need to get the day\u2019s grime off, including makeup, oil, pollution and dirt to decrease the risk of skin irritation, clogged pores and acne.

Despite the common myth, moisturizers do NOT cause pimples. If you have oily skin and are worried, pick a product that is oil-free. If you have acne or redness, pick one with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\">niacinamide</a> (vitamin B3), to combat that redness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1)\u00a0 AM: Use sunscreen</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2)\u00a0 PM: Wash your face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) PM:\u00a0\u00a0Use retinoid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) PM: Apply\u00a0moisturizer before bed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have 30+ years of data showing that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">topical retinoids (vitamin A)</a> help with reducing fine lines by increasing collagen synthesis and decreasing collagen breakdown. They also correct sun damage\u00a0and improve skin texture and discoloration. \u00a0Topical retinoids increase cell turnover, which is why some people experience irritation if they use too much or do not follow it with a moisturizer. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many over-the-counter products contain retinol, the pre-drug of tretinoin. Tretinoin is a prescription drug you get from your dermatologist that can directly activate your skin, while retinol needs to be converted into tretinoin by the body before it can get to work. Studies show you need a strength of 0.25% retinol or 0.025% tretinoin for it to be strong enough to cause these positive changes in the skin. After washing your face, but before your face cream, apply a very small amount and start slow, using it just twice a week, only at night, and work up from there.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a lot of concern about sun sensitivity with retinoids. Because it increases cell turnover, the top layer of dead skin is less thick. This layer can provide an SPF of 2 to 4. Provided you are using a\u00a0daily sunscreen, it is OK to use retinoids all year round.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1)</span>\u00a0AM: Apply an a<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ntioxidant serum.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) AM: Use sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) PM: Wash your face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) PM: Use retinoid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) PM: Apply\u00a0moisturizer before bed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple studies show that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">serums with vitamins C</a> and vitamin E protect your skin against photoaging. They work because these vitamins function as antioxidants, neutralizing the damaging free radicals created by the sun and pollution before they activate the breakdown of collagen. It\u2019s important to know that the skin is very good at keeping things out, so these antioxidants need to be in a well-formulated vehicle that absorbs easily into the skin to ensure those important and expensive vitamins get deep enough into the skin to protect it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antioxidants and retinol serums are typically more expensive and not sought out until the first signs of aging begin, but they are safe to use at any age (</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">unless you are pregnant)</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In fact, many teenagers are prescribed tretinoin in the form of retin-A for acne. If you have started using it for acne, I suggest that you keep using it even after your skin improves. Simply switch to a more moisturizing formula to make it more tolerable for less oily skin.</span></p>"},

Try the magic of moisturizer. \u201cIt increases the lipid barrier on the upper part of the skin, decreasing the exposure of these nerve fibers,\u201d explains Galadari.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A number of things can cause itchy rashes, but the most common are hives and atopic dermatitis. Oftentimes, \u201cthere\u2019s a release of histamine that activates the C nerve fibers,\u201d says Galadari.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It depends largely on the cause, according to Galadari. Most of the time, an antihistamine or just proper hygiene\u2014like washing the area with a gentle cleanser and applying emollients and over-the-counter corticosteroid creams\u2014can help. But if your rash doesn\u2019t improve within several days, see your doctor to get a specific diagnosis and treatment plan.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odds are that you\u2019ve been plagued by summertime mosquito bites. While a mosquito won\u2019t cover a large area, it does leave behind its saliva, which provokes a skin reaction. On the bright side, \u201cThe itch of a bite is pretty localized, and it looks like a bump,\u201d says Galadari, making it easy to identify.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, prevent bites by wearing creams or lotions that contain DEET, says Galadari, especially if you\u2019re going to be outside or in warm, humid weather. If a bug gets you anyway, Galadari recommends taking an antihistamine and applying an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to the area. If the swelling is more painful than itchy\u2014or you have trouble breathing, which can indicate an allergy\u2014see a doctor ASAP.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eczema</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and psoriasis can cause an itchy feeling, but they look completely different on your skin. \u201cEczema starts as dry skin that\u2019s itchy,\u201d says Galadari. \u201cThe repeated scratching may cause possible infection and the area appears oozing and rough.\u201d Psorasis, on the other hand, appears as silvery, scaly plaque on the skin, and, unlike eczema, doesn\u2019t always itch.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you suspect you have either skin disease, visit your derm for a definitive diagnosis. Only then will you be able to get the proper treatment\u2014and relief from the itchiness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ugh, allergies. \u201cContact dermatitis occurs when a patient encounters an allergen,\u201d explains Galadari. \u201cThis can be anything from metals, such as nickel, to everyday materials such as hair dye or even leather.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you know what substance may have caused it, then take care to avoid that in the future. If you\u2019re still not sure, go to your doctor. \u201cThe doctor may use a method called patch-testing to learn exactly what it is you\u2019re allergic to,\u201d says Galadari.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those itchy, red or white splotches that seem to appear out of nowhere occur when your skin is angry and instigates a reaction from your immune system. Anything from certain foods, medications, infections and even sudden changes in temperature can trigger a flare of </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hives</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since hives are an immune reaction, over-the-counter antihistamines are your best bet. But if you notice any swelling of the lips and throat or your hives last longer than a week, see your derm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAny medication that causes dryness may cause itchiness,\u201d says Galadari. That could involve anything from statins, which lower cholesterol, to isotretinoin, an anti-acne ingredient that can have a drying effect on skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be wise and moisturize. Make sure you\u2019re doing so regularly, says Galadari. If the itchiness is unbearable, see your doctor, who may need to adjust the dosage of your medications.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cChanges in the hormones cause itchiness, as does the stretching of the skin,\u201d says Galadari. Sometimes, internal changes during pregnancy (like those in the liver) may exacerbate it, too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Certain medications may help with itchiness during pregnancy, but they depend on what, exactly, is causing it. Visit your doctor to get a confirmed diagnosis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since itchiness is mediated by the C nerve fibers\u2014which are part of your nervous system\u2014anything that messes with your nervous system can lead to itchy skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A topical capsaicin cream can help, according to Galadari. If it\u2019s more severe, \u201cOther medications may also be used to help decrease nerve activity,\u201d he says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What Causes It:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Just thinking about how itchy your skin is can definitely make it worse, since the brain is connected to those nerve fibers that cause itchiness. Plus, \u201cThere are also conditions such as OCD, in which a patient has an unexplained compulsion to scratch,\u201d says Galadari. \u201cThat can exacerbate itchiness and make matters worse.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to Treat It: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaking the itch-scratch cycle\u2014whether by covering the itchy area so it\u2019s difficult to scratch or even keeping your nails super short\u2014is key. Cognitive behavioral therapy may also help, as can medications, in the case of mental health causes like OCD.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Deanna Pai is a freelance beauty writer in New York, NY.

There are so many types of products out there, and there\u2019s no way to craft the right routine for yourself if you don\u2019t even know what these products do.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re scratching your head wondering what the difference is between face oil and serum\u2014and how the heck you use either of them\u2014stress no more. Dermatologists <a href=\"https://www.skinandlasers.com/dermatologist-margarita-lolis-md/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Margarita Lolis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.drjaliman.com/debra-jaliman-md.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a> are here to give you the rundown on all the types of products for skin health, so you know what they are, what they do and how to properly use them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most dermatologists agree it is important to cleanse the face twice daily to get bacteria, dirt and pollutants off your skin. However, there are different types of cleansers that are more ideal for certain types of skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe common mistakes people make are using the same product in the morning and at night and not getting a product that is ideal for their skin type,\u201d says Dr. Lolis. \u201cFor example, someone prone to breakouts may use a cleanser with salicylic acid only to find it has a reverse effect. When skin is dried out, it increases oil production, which can only make a breakout more prevalent. The best approach would be to see a dermatologist for a skin assessment and a product recommendation that is most suitable for your skin type.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exfoliating is important, as it helps to take dead skin cells off the surface of the skin and to give your skin a glow, and it should be done once or twice a week. Many exfoliants contain ingredients such as rice enzymes, sugar granules and walnut shells, which help to revive dull skin. \u201cIf oily skin and breakouts are a concern, try one with charcoal,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cIf your skin is sensitive, opt for an exfoliating mask as opposed to a scrub, which can be irritating.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSerums usually contain antioxidants, which help fight free radical damage,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cThey can also contain anti-aging ingredients such as retinols and peptides, which stimulate collagen production.\u201d Because they penetrate deep into the skin, these products are great for hydrating dry skin. They are best used after your cleanser, and they can be used underneath moisturizer to treat the skin while sleeping.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nutrient-filled face oils help to build a resilient layer for your skin, no matter your skin type. They can be very hydrating, which makes them especially useful for those with dry skin. \u201cArgan oil and vitamin E are great for pretty much every skin type and issue,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cIdeally, add two or three drops to a moisturizer or serum. For acne-prone skin, tea tree oil will work very well and vitamin C oil will help with any scarring.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sunscreens are essential for protecting your skin from UV damage, no matter the season. Luckily, there are plenty of ways to apply sunscreen beyond just the typical bottle. \u201cEveryone should be using a moisturizer with SPF even in winter,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cIf you\u2019re outside or live in warmer climates, it\u2019s even more important to protect your face. The key is to know your skin type and use sunscreen that is a suitable fit. Some sunscreens are greasy and may clog pores. This is why it\u2019s best to use a moisturizer formulated to address a particular skin issue that has sunscreen built in.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help keep your skin looking younger, Lolis recommends using moisturizer from head to toe. \u201cThe face, neck and d\u00e9colletage should get moisturizer twice daily as should elbows, knees and feet,\u201d she says. There are many kinds of moisturizers available for different skin types, but if you really want to keep your skin hydrated, look for moisturizers that contain glycerin or hyaluronic acid, suggests Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chemical peels remove the outer layer of the skin, which means they tend to go deeper to remove excess dead skin cells than exfoliators. They usually contain glycolic, salicylic or lactic acids. \u201cUse it once every two weeks, but avoid these if you are prone to rosacea and eczema,\u201d says Jaliman. Chemical peels tend to be more intense and typically are done by a professional, but there are also at-home DIY peels available to address things such as acne scars, wrinkles, sun damage and hyperpigmentation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Toner can be used after a cleanser twice a day to remove excess traces of makeup or other residue from the skin. \u201cToners shrink pores and restore skin to its natural pH balance,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cThis is important because when our pH levels are thrown out of whack due to soaps and chemicals in cleansers, oil production increases, causing a cycle of breakouts.\u201d Those with sensitive skin should use an alcohol-free toner.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many different types of masks on the market, ranging from hydrating, to drying and even brightening, which makes them useful for all skin types. \u201cDone weekly, you\u2019ll see a change to skin, and breakouts will have a chance to dry up and heal,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cI am also a fan of using soothing masks on the cheeks and then a clarifying mask on the forehead, chin and jawline. It\u2019s okay to mix it up. The key is to apply a mask to clean, exfoliated skin so there isn\u2019t anything blocking it from penetrating the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eye creams tend to be formulated for specific eye area issues such as puffiness, wrinkles and dark circles. \u201cThere are some creams that tackle several issues at once, and these contain things like caffeine, glycerine, chamomile, hyaluronic acid, antioxidants and peptides,\u201d says Lolis. \u201cEye creams are specially formulated to penetrate the finer skin around the eyes.\u201d They can be used once or twice a day, but look for retinol or peptide eye creams to use at night, as they stimulate collagen production, suggests Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carina Wolff is a health and wellness writer based out of Los Angeles.

Rogers \u00b7 January 3, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a dermatologist, I often get asked about my daily skin care regimen. Here\u2019s a look at the products I use as a 41-year-old woman with dry skin and pigment problems (melasma).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) I start the day by splashing my face with water. I prefer not to wash my face completely.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) Then I pick one of two serums:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">OR</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) Once the serum I selected has absorbed, I move onto eye cream. I need all the moisture I can get in the fall and winter to help with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-crepey-skin/\">crepey skin</a> around my eyes, but I also want to fight the look of bags and dark circles due to my chronic sleep deprivation. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Teamine+Eye+Complex_5064.htm#headingDetails\"><strong>Teamine Eye Complex</strong></a> does just that!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) When choosing a face cream, I like products with glycerin and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyaluronic+Acid_500277.htm\">hyaluronic acid</a> to keep my dry skin moisturized. I love the texture and long-lasting hydration found in <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Restorative+Nighttime+BioTherapy_58126.htm\">Restorative Nighttime Bio-Therapy by Replenix</a></strong>. Although it\u2019s labeled for nighttime use, you can use it whenever you want!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) Now it\u2019s sunscreen time. For me, it\u2019s all about zinc oxide for the best and safest broad spectrum protection. Zinc protects your skin from UVB rays that cause sunburns and UVA rays are responsible for wrinkles and brown spots. I wear at least SPF 30 with 15% zinc oxide every day. My favorite is the <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_MD+Creme+Mineral+Beauty+Balm+SPF+50+UVAUVB_58289.htm\">MD Creme Mineral\u00a0Beauty Balm\u00a0by MDSolarSciences</a>.</strong> It has the perfect amount of tint along with a matte finish.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6) After my skin care routine is complete, I curl my lashes and apply mascara. I\u2019m a big fan of\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Volumizing+Mascara_22219.htm\">Volumizing Mascara by RevitaLash</a></strong>\u2014it\u2019s the only makeup product I carry in my office.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">7) Lastly, I never leave the house or office without my <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sunforgettable+Loose+Mineral+Powder+Brush+SPF+30_4688.htm\">Colorescience Sunforgettable Loose Mineral Powder Blush</a>.</strong> It\u2019s great for touch-ups throughout the day and perfect for storing in my bag, car and at work.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1) At the end of the day, it\u2019s time to take a deep breath and wash up. I alternate between the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Cream+Cleanser+_33079.htm\">Cream Cleanser</a>\u00a0by iS Clinical, a glycerin-based cleanser that can remove makeup without stripping my skin and <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AHABHA+Exfoliating+Cleanser_53511.htm\">SkinMedica\u2019s\u00a0AHA/BHA Exfoliating \u00a0Cleanser</a></strong>, a gentle chemical exfoliating cleanser with glycolic acid to remove any dry skin buildup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">2) Then I pat my skin dry and apply a pea size amount of 0.5% retinol to my face, neck and chest, avoiding my eyelids, corners of nose and lips. I really like <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AHABHA+Exfoliating+Cleanser_53511.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol .05 Refining Night Cream</a></strong> because it\u2019s easy to apply and lasts about 6 months!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">3) If I feel a bit dry or flaky, I skip the retinol and use <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Resurface+High+Potency+Cream++20+Bionic+AHA_9751.htm\">NeoStrata\u2019s\u00a0Resurface High Potency Cream 18%</a></strong> to smooth my skin without involving any harsh physical exfoliation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">4) Once a month I do a charcoal mask to minimize the appearance of my pores. The\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Detoxifying+Mask_72641.htm\">Detoxifying Mask\u00a0by PCA</a></strong> is lovely because it\u2019s not too drying on my skin and it does a great job of cleaning out my pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">5) Also, I have a thing for long eyelashes so I apply an eyelash conditioning product a few times a week. I noticed that if I do it every day my lashes get too long and spidery. I found that <strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_VLumine+Lash+Serum_69062.htm\">V\u2019Lumine Lash Serum by RevitaLash</a></strong> works great and isn\u2019t irritating like some other products can be.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">6) I conclude my nighttime regimen with the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Doctor+Rogers+RESTORE+Healing+Balm_74553.htm\"><strong>RESTORE Healing Balm</strong></a> I developed to my lips, eyelids and cuticles. Now I can go to bed knowing my driest spots will get the overnight intensive hydration they need to look good in the morning!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Let me know the products you can\u2019t live without and next week I\u2019ll share with you my must-have items.</p>"},

Men also produce more oil and experience acne for longer periods of time than women, adds Pollock. Your skin care routine doesn\u2019t have to be complicated, though.

For everyday use, look for a moisturizer with SPF, preferably one with antioxidants to help ward off aging and free radicals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To make things easier for you, we\u2019ve rounded up the best moisturizers for men. Keep reading for our top face moisturizers, then get to slathering one on your skin!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This lightweight moisturizer by Lab Series is a true multitasker. It provides all-day hydration (without leaving skin greasy), offers sun protection and contains antioxidants like coffee-seed extract to shield skin from free radicals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since men\u2019s skin tends to be on the oilier side, you might find yourself looking a tad shiny during the day. Enter Baxter of California\u2019s Oil Free Moisturizer, which leaves skin with a matte finish. It\u2019s formulated with plant extracts (including aloe) to strengthen the moisture barrier and soothe.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chock full of ultra-hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and shea butter, this moisturizer with SPF is a great daytime pick for guys with dry skin. It\u2019s also formulated with lipids, vitamins and nutrients, which can minimize the look of wrinkles and dark spots.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t let acne get you down. This lightweight, oil-free moisturizer by Menscience Androceuticals features a one-two punch of salicylic and glycolic acid, both of which contain exfoliating properties. These two ingredients can help keep pimples at bay and prevent wrinkles and ingrown hairs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Does your skin get red from all that shaving you do? If so, reach for a moisturizer that can help you deal with inflammation, like this one by Jack Black. It curbs redness thanks to skin-soothing ingredients like blue algae extract and sea parsley.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your face is oily in some areas and dry in others, you likely have combination skin. Luckily, this moisturizer by Anthony is just what your skin needs. Vitamin B5 conditions the skin\u2019s texture, while chamomile and aloe vera boast\u00a0calming properties.</p>"},

Rogers \u00b7 January 15, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To those who have read my post about my\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/dermatologist-recommended-skincare/\">personal skin care regimen,</a>\u00a0I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering how to get that same level of care if you\u2019re on a budget. This week, Dermstore has challenged me to PARE DOWN my skin care routine, which means I have to create a dermatologist-approved skin care plan for three months on a budget of $300 or less. The good news? It\u2019s possible\u2014if you know which products you really need to invest in as well as which products you can spend less on.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to slowing down the aging process, here are three products I can\u2019t live without\u2014and where the majority of my budget will go:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I had to sacrifice the growth factors found in another favorite product, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_TNS+Essential+Serum_16498.htm\">SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum</a>, I still picked an antioxidant that has data to prove that its formulation penetrates into the skin and protects it from the damaging free radicals from the sun and pollution.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAntioxidant serums\u201d are a bit of an industry buzzword; it is important to note that only a few antioxidant serums have the research to validate that their products can do what they say they can do. This research is expensive to complete, which is why serums tend to be pricier. When it comes to my skin, I favor the products that are scientifically proven because </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in order for key ingredients to get deep enough into the skin to protect it, they need to be in a very well-formulated vehicle (aka \u201cserum\u201d).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, the above products leave me with less than $50 to spend on the rest of my skin care regimen. That\u2019s fine, I already have my top picks:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face cleansers have one key job to do: clean the day off the face. \u00a0They are only on your skin for a short period of time, but if they are too strong or drying, they can do harm in that short period of time. A wonderful, safe skin care product line is\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Vanicream+Cleansing+Bar_1005.htm\"><b>Vanicream</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Its cleansing bar will remove eye makeup without drying out your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face creams sit on the top of your skin, pulling and holding moisture in the top layers of the skin. They contain large water binding molecules that are too large to penetrate the skin. So, buying an expensive face cream with amazing anti-aging ingredients does not mean those ingredients will get to where they need to be in order for the skin to be able to use them. Instead, it is better to get the anti-aging ingredients in a serum that can penetrate the skin, and then follow it with a moisturizer that will protect and hydrate the skin. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, as I have just done, spend your money on your serums and then get a face cream with a good texture that leaves your skin feeling perfectly hydrated so you can better tolerate the more powerful treatments.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the price,</span> this moisturizer from Derma e<b>\u00a0</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is an elegant face cream that will hydrate your skin without the most common allergen and unwanted chemicals.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another great option is <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Vanicream+Skin+Cream+Pump_1007.htm\"><b>Vanicream Skin Cream Pump</b></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ($17.19 for 1 pound). Vanicream is my favorite body moisturizer because it is </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free of dyes, perfume, fragrance, parabens, lanolin and formaldehyde</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is also a great face cream but takes a bit longer to absorb into the skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we all love a good eye cream, you\u2019ll notice this is not my \u201cmust have\u201d list because a good, gentle face cream can be applied around your eyes to keep them well moisturized.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope all this information helps you feel empowered to make great skin care choices for yourself. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns in the comments section below!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warmly,</span></p>"},

Let\u2019s dive into this enzyme, heralded as one of the </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-anti-aging-ingredients/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best anti-aging ingredients</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to see exactly what it does for our skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CoQ10, also known as ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10, is an enzyme that exists in every cell of our bodies. Our bodies naturally produce it (though production diminishes as we age), and it aids in cell growth and maintenance. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NYC esthetician Nichelle Temple, owner of\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://inderma.studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inderma Studio</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, explains how important this multifunctional compound is. \u201cIt\u2019s said to boost energy and speed recovery from exercise,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also functions as an antioxidant, neutralizing free radicals and keeping cells healthy,\u201d meaning it can help prevent premature aging.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lots. First, it helps produce 95% of the body\u2019s energy. CoQ10 also plays a crucial role in many chemical reactions in our cells, Temple explains. \u201cCoQ10 is vital in making skin look younger and maintaining a healthy metabolism.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we age, our bodies are less able to naturally produce CoQ10. This depletion, Temple notes, contributes to \u201cthe skin\u2019s inability to quickly produce collagen and elastin.\u201d Cue sagging. A deficiency of CoQ10 \u201ccan cause the skin to wrinkle, and the body may struggle to lose extra weight because of the decrease in cells\u2019 energy.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While our bodies are less able to naturally produce CoQ10 as we age, the cosmetic and health industries are ready to help with an array of products that incorporate this enzyme, supplementing for any deficiency and working its magic on our bodies. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Why We Love It:</strong>\u00a0Offering a luminous glow, the cream works on many levels, encouraging collagen growth, diminishing fine lines and neutralizing free radicals\u2014all thanks to CoQ10.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What the Experts Think:</strong> This cream is great because it offers benefits for just about anyone, Temple says, \u201cIt\u2019s deeply hydrating for dry, sensitive and mature skin types.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Reviews Say:</strong> \u201cA little goes a long way.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-get-rid-of-dark-circles/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">6 Dark Circles Solutions Dermatologists Swear By</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Lindsay Tigar \u00b7 January 19, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From DIY treatments that involve cold tea bags to high-tech devices that promise to erase evidence of sleep deprivation, you\u2019ll try anything to get rid of dark circles under your eyes. The good news is that even dermatologists struggle with this issue\u2014and they know a thing or two about how to deal with it. But the first step? It\u2019s understanding what causes it in the first place.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Celebrity dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Lancer+Skincare_504231.htm?keyword=lancer%20skincare\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Harold Lancer</a> explains that while those heavy bags under your eyes often put your sleep quality in question, that isn\u2019t the only reason behind them. Sleep definitely contributes to their appearance, especially if you battle insomnia several days in a row, but Dr. Lancer explains that they can also be shadows cast by puffy lids, hollowness that occurs with age or the thinning of the skin around your eye area, making them more noticeable. He also says you could potentially blame your mother or grandmother for this discoloration, as it is also a hereditary trait.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Founder of the Dermatology and Laser Group in New York, <a href=\"http://dermatologyandlasergroup.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Arash Akhavan, MD, FAAD</a> adds that excess sun exposure can also increase the likelihood of waking up with those pesky under-eye shades, giving you another reason to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/where-to-apply-sunscreen/\">not to skip sunscreen</a>, especially on your face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help combat these causes, dermatologists have a few go-to formulas they swear by. Here are a few to get you started:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because this cream is rich in hyaluronic acid, Dr. Akhavan says it gives your skin an instant plump around the eyes, improving the appearance and removing any puffiness that may be causing the discoloration. He also notes that antioxidants and growth factors within the formula contribute to the long-term production of collagen. Since losing that all-too-important anti-aging superstar can make your dark circles a shade darker, creating more of it is a win for this cream.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To alleviate those darker colors, you don\u2019t always have to splurge on a luxe product, according to Dr. Akhavan. Some products, like this eye cream, delivers results without the hefty price tag, thanks to its hero ingredients vitamin B and niacinamide, which decrease inflammation while increasing circulation. When put together, he says you will witness less puffiness all around.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you happen to be in the camp that has primarily pigment issues under your eyes, Dr. Akhavan says this cream uses potent vitamin C to help even out and repair your complexion. Also, if you prefer a lighter formula over a thicker one, this is a great product to try with its fluid texture and safe-for-all-skin-types formula.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coffee\u2019s centerpiece ingredient\u2014caffeine!\u2014doesn\u2019t just wake you up for that 8:30 a.m. conference call meeting. It can also help diffuse your under-eye bandits. Since this cream is equipped with a proprietary blend of sheer light diffusers and caffeine-based agents, it makes your skin look younger and firmer, shooing away those bags. \u201cTake your ring finger and gently pat the cream around the eye once or twice daily and your eyes will appear hydrated and refreshed,\u201d Dr. Lancer says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Developers of this anti-aging device were inspired by the traditional Asian fingertip tapping-eye massage, which is meant to help improve the youthful appearance around your baby blues (or greens or browns). The idea is to put this device into action after you apply your go-to cream. Using Alternating T-Sonic technology to tap your skin, this device fights against signs of aging, crow\u2019s feet and dark, puffy circles. With one charge lasting up to 140 uses, you can easily use this daily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s better than a concealer that does more than what its name claims? One that also treats as it covers. This one will not only last throughout your work day and happy hour with time-controlled staying power, but it also boasts anti-aging ingredients and offers firming qualities to decrease the appearance of bags with each use, too.</p>"},

Since much of the body\u2019s repair process happens during sleep, sacrificing slumber to the party gods can <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/the-science-of-beauty-sleep/\">interfere with skin cell turnover and repair</a>. \u201cThis can lead to the new skin cells not being formed correctly,\u201d says Nancy. \u201cLack of sleep also puts the body into a state of stress, resulting in the release of stress-related hormones that can cause inflammation, including breakouts.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cNo matter what your skin type,\u201d says Nancy, \u201cyou will need to rehydrate and plump up those skin cells.\u201d Luckily, there is <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Mask_300028.htm\">a facial mask for every skin type</a> that can jump-start repairs and help combat party-induced woes.\u00a0Not sure which face mask is right for you? We\u2019ve done our homework. These at-home face masks will help you accomplish your most pressing skin care objectives on your own time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is it:</strong> Normal to dry skin types will benefit from a cream mask, which is \u201crich in oils and moisturizers that penetrate deeply and replenish dry cells,\u201d according to Nancy Reagan, licensed aesthetician and founder of Bella Reina Spa in Delray Beach, Florida. Masks that contain hyaluronic acid have the added benefit of attracting and binding moisture to plump up flat skin cells, while algae extracts will help tighten and firm.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What is it:</strong> A restorative, moisturizing clay mask that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-detox-skin/\">naturally detoxifies skin</a> as it hydrates without oil is a great option for normal and oily skin types. \u201cBecause they are occlusive (closing off the skin to the air), clay masks cause the brain to send down natural skin plumpers,\u201d Nancy says, \u201cand at the same time they are firming, detoxing and tightening.\u201d If your skin is inflamed, look for a clay mask that also boasts clarifying enzymes and/or sulfur to treat breakouts and soothe redness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tip:\u00a0</strong>Frustrated that clay-based mask is leaving residue everywhere? Whatever you do, don\u2019t forcibly rub your skin to remove it. Instead, enlist the help of a warm, wet washcloth and let it sit on your skin for a minute or so. The steam will \u201cloosen\u201d the product and easy, gentle removal will be well within your reach.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although sheet masks work with all skin types based on the formulas they contain, they are particularly excellent for resistant skin types when paired with serums. \u201cJust like we do in the treatment rooms, you will want to apply hyaluronic serums under it so that the occlusive nature of the mask can push the serums deep into the skin,\u201d Reagan says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Exfoliating masks slough off dulling dead skin cells and purge deep-seated dirt in your pores using hydroxy acids (like glycolic and lactic acids) and fruit enzymes (typically from papaya and pineapple).

Luckily, there are skin care products specifically designed to help boost cell renewal and collagen production while we sleep, making us look more radiant and well-rested the next day. We\u2019re talking about sleeping masks and night creams. While both these products are great at what they do, both aren\u2019t one and the same. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about these two nighttime skin heroes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicago-based dermatologist\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.dnadermatology.com/chicago-loop-il-dermatology-staff.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Toral Patel</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0\u201cNight creams are the same as night moisturizers. They typically contain ingredients that hydrate the skin in addition to delivering active ingredients that can help with anti-aging concerns.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board-certified dermatologist</span> <a href=\"https://curology.com/medical-team\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. David Lortscher</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adds that night cream formulas are typically thicker than your daytime creams, and contain ingredients you can\u2019t normally wear during the day, like retinol. \u201cThe consistency of a night cream tends to be too heavy to wear during the day and may be targeted for night because they contain retinol, which is best used at night.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, sleeping masks, which have taken Western skin care by storm, are adapted from the Korean skin care routine. \u201cTypically formulated for overnight use, sleeping masks are meant to be massaged onto the skin, allowing time for your skin to be soothed and more intensely hydrated. Ingredients in sleeping masks are mild enough for your skin to tolerate overnight,\u201d Dr. Lorstcher explains.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Used as a final part of your night regimen, sleeping masks are formulated depending on your skin type and skin concern. \u201cSleeping masks are used to seal in your facial serums, creams and oils. Those with dry skin would immensely benefit from ingredients like argan oil, lavender and ceramide that hydrate and help repair the skin\u2019s barrier while keeping it smooth and plump,\u201d says Dr. Patel.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have oily or acne-prone skin, dryness may not be your top concern, so Dr. Patel recommends choosing sleeping masks with light moisturizers like hyaluronic acid as this hydrates the skin without clogging the pores, reducing the likelihood of breakouts. On the other hand, sleeping masks with retinol and vitamin A derivatives are best for aging or mature skin, says Dr. Lorstcher, as these ingredients help in improving the skin\u2019s texture and elasticity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because they often share similar ingredients, Dr. Lorstcher says using either night creams or sleeping masks\u2014or both alternately\u2014can effectively boost your nighttime regimen and help address the signs of aging. \u201cIdeally, sleeping masks should be used two to three times a week, but you can use it in place of your moisturizer as long as your skin can tolerate it,\u201d she adds.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to try both?

In particular, your 30s are a time to get serious about anti-aging and start incorporating skin care essentials that target fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots and other premature signs of aging. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To find out the must-have skin care products for your 30s, we tapped </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/dr-heather-d-rogers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Heather Rogers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, top board-certified dermatologist and fellowship-trained dermatologic surgeon. Find out what she had to say, ahead. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like in your 20s, a daily cleanser in your 30s is a must. That said, many of us experience a change in our skin type and veer toward the combination side of the spectrum. To combat this, Dr. Rogers suggests switching to a cleanser formulated with combination skin types in mind.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Cleansing+Complex_10796.htm\">iS Clinical Cleansing Complex </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking for a must-have cleanser for your 30s? Look no further than the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex. Formulated for women of all ages who experience breakouts and dry skin, the Cleansing Complex works to smooth out the complexion, reduce pore-clogging oil, kickstart cellular turnover and even reduce the look of large pores. In addition to cleansing, it can also protect the skin from skin-aging free radicals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two antioxidants to keep on your radar? Vitamins C and E. \u201cMultiple studies show that antioxidant serums with vitamins C and E can protect your skin against photo-aging and lighten pigment,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cThey work because these vitamins function as antioxidants, neutralizing the damaging free radicals created by the sun and pollution before they activate the breakdown of collagen,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to an antioxidant treatment, Dr. Rogers suggests incorporating a retinol product into your routine in your 30s. Also known as vitamin A, retinol is an anti-aging powerhouse that can reduce blemishes, boost cell regeneration and target premature signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles and more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+05+Refining+Night+Cream_4506.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.5 Refining Night Cream </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a retinol skin care product to add to your night time routine, Dr. Rogers recommends SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.5 Refining Night Cream. The intensive night cream works to prevent skin damage, regenerate the skin, promote collagen production, minimize the look of large pores and target blemishes for clearer, more youthful-looking skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In your 30s\u2014and any decade, for that matter\u2014moisturizer is a must. Whether you have dry skin or combination skin, topping your skin care routine off with a moisturizer can promote softer, smoother, more supple-looking skin. The trick is to find one that hydrates as it addresses your skin concern, whether that\u2019s adult acne, blackheads, emerging fine lines or dullness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UFO+UltraClarifying+Acne+Treatment+Face+Oil_70305.htm\">Sunday Riley U.F.O Ultra-Clarifying Acne Treatment Face Oil</a>\u00a0</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for a multipurpose moisturizer, Dr. Rogers suggests a fast-absorbing dry oil like Sunday Riley U.F.O. Ultra-Clarifying Face Oil. Formulated with a blend of natural botanicals like tea tree and chamomile oil, as well as licorice root, hexylresorcinol and 1.5% salicylic acid, the clarifying face oil works to target acne, blackheads and blemishes and combat fine lines, wrinkles and other premature signs of aging. The result? Skin that appears clearer and more youthful than before.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As many women in their 30s are fighting melasma and need all the sun protection they can get, Dr. Rogers suggest a sunscreen formulated with zinc. \u201cZinc is able to protect your skin from both the UVB rays that cause sunburns and the longer UVA rays that can come through windows and are more responsible for wrinkles and brown spots.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_MD+Creme+Mineral+Beauty+Balm+SPF+50+UVAUVB_58289.htm\">MDSolarSciences MD Creme Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50 </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a daily sunscreen in your 30s,\u00a0</span>Dr. Rogers suggests MDSolarSciences MD Creme Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. Formulated with natural mineral UV filters and anti-aging antioxidants\u2014including vitamins C and E\u2014the lightweight formula is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation for daily use and can conceal imperfections, control shine and mattify the complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At this age, as most of us move up the corporate ladder and experience life-altering moments like childbirth, our skin becomes faced with different challenges, and you\u2019ll see this in the form of a sallow complexion, uneven skin tone, increased sensitivity, dryness and enlarged pores. \u201cAfter 15 years of hormones pushing out oil onto our skin, our pores have widened and become a collecting place of dead skin, causing blackheads or open comedones,\u201d she adds. To combat this, Dr. Rogers suggests incorporating detoxifying face masks or peels into your weekly routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Yam+and+Pumpkin+Enzyme+Peel_8554.htm\">Eminence Organic Skin Care Yam and Pumpkin Enzyme Peel</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the first signs of age appear around the eye, Dr. Rogers suggests using a nourishing eye cream \u201cto ensure this thin skin gets the hydration it needs.\u201d In addition to nourishing the eye contour, eye cream can also help reduce the look of premature signs of eye aging, like fine lines, wrinkles and crow\u2019s-feet.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Renew+Eye+Gel++Daily+Eye+Therapy_27493.htm\">EltaMD Renew Eye Gel Daily Eye Therapy </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an eye cream in your 30s, Dr. Rogers suggests trying the EltaMD Renew Eye Gel Daily Eye Therapy. Enriched with moisturizing superstar hyaluronic acid, the anti-aging eye cream works to give the eye contour a burst of hydration while softening the skin and diminishing the look of lines and wrinkles. In addition, vitamin B3, antioxidants and anti-aging peptides target puffiness and dark circles by improving circulation, stimulating collagen and protecting the delicate under-eye skin from falling victim to free-radical damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think you can say goodbye to acne treatments in your 30s? Unfortunately not for some us. \u201cAs our pattern of acne often becomes more hormonal, getting pimples on the lower half of the face around our period,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. That said, since your skin can be a lot drier than in your 20s, Dr. Rogers suggests using a treatment that has a low percentage of benzoyl peroxide and won\u2019t dry the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Effaclar+Duo+Acne+Treatment+with+Benzoyl+Peroxide_31879.htm\">La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo Acne Treatment with Benzoyl Peroxide</a></b></p>"},

According to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Doctor.Rogers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Heather Rogers</a>, board-certified dermatologist and fellowship-trained dermatologic surgeon, \u201cBy our 40s, our skin turnover rate has slowed to more than double that of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-routine-20s/\">our early 20s</a> (45 days vs. 20 days on average). Our healing from scrapes and acne takes much longer [and by now] we\u2019ve had plenty of time in the sun and pollution to damage our skin\u2019s DNA, increasing our risk of cancer and breaking down of our skin\u2019s collagen faster than we can replace it.\u201d In addition, \u201cWrinkles appear in areas of the face with the most movement, [such as] the forehead, between the eyebrows [and] around the eyes and mouth.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While all of this may sound a little scary, fortunately there are things you can do to make this seem less intimidating. Up ahead, we share <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/dermatologist-recommended-skincare/\">Dr. Rogers\u2019 must-have skin care products</a> for your 40s.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like all other decades in your life, cleansing the skin on a daily basis is an absolute must. According to Dr. Rogers, washing your face before bed not only helps to get rid of the day\u2019s grime of oil, makeup, pollution and dirt, it also decreases the chance of getting clogged pores. As Dr. Rogers notes, \u201cIt\u2019s also the first step in helping your skin cells in their efforts to reverse the day\u2019s wear and tear.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Deep+Cleansing+Oil_37986.htm\">DHC Deep Cleansing Oil </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a daily cleanser that will rid the skin of the day\u2019s dirt and debris, and nourish and hydrate the skin, Dr. Rogers suggests DHC Deep Cleansing Oil. Enriched with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/olive-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">nourishing olive oil</a> and vitamin E, this product not only cleanses but hydrates the skin without leaving behind a slick of oil.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like your 30s, your 40s are all about protection and prevention with the help of powerful antioxidants. Which is why Dr. Rogers suggests keeping an antioxidant-rich serum on deck to help protect the skin from the repercussions of sun exposure and pollution.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Super+Serum+Advance+Plus_15852.htm\">iS Clinical Super Serum Advance Plus </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For an antioxidant-rich serum that will help rejuvenate and protect your skin in your 40s, Dr. Rogers recommends iS Clinical Super Serum Advance Plus. Formulated with natural ingredients that work to protect the skin against sun damage and aging, the antioxidant-rich facial serum can improve your overall complexion, encourage collagen production and protect against UV and environmental damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you may have added a retinol skin care product to your routine in your 30s, your 40s are all about the anti-aging super ingredient. \u201cWe have 40+ years of scientific data showing that topical retinoids (vitamin A) help with reducing fine lines by increasing collagen synthesis and decreasing collagen breakdown,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cRetinol also corrects sun damage and improves skin texture and discoloration by increasing cell turnover,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+05+Refining+Night+Cream_4506.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.5 Refining Night Cream</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking for a retinol skin care product to add to your lineup? Dr. Rogers recommends SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.5 Refining Night Cream. The intensive night cream works to prevent skin damage, regenerate the skin, promote collagen production, minimize the look of large pores and target blemishes for clearer, more youthful-looking skin. \u201cAfter washing and drying your face at night, but before you apply face cream, use a very small amount,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cStart slow, using it just twice a week, only at night, and work up from there,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you use too much, it can overstimulate cell turnover, causing irritation and peeling\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No matter your age, face cream is always a must. For your 40s, Dr. Rogers suggests a more focused moisturizer that helps target signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles, dark spots and more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Kale+Spinach+Age+Prevention+Cream_68569.htm\">Youth to the People Kale + Spinach Age Prevention Cream </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as a daily moisturizer is concerned, Dr. Rogers suggests giving Youth to the People Kale + Spinach Age Prevention Cream a try. Formulated with kale, spinach and green tea, this superfood-packed moisturizer works to restore, rejuvenate and protect the skin from environmental skin aggressors like the sun and pollution. Perfect for both day and night, its 100% vegan formula leaves the skin looking and feeling ultra-soft and ultra-healthy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you get serious about retinol, you should also get serious about sun protection. \u201cBecause it increases cell turnover, the top layer of dead skin cells is less thick (this layer can provide an SPF of 2 to 4),\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cProvided you are using daily sunscreen, it\u2019s okay to use retinoids year-round,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_MD+Creme+Mineral+Beauty+Balm+SPF+50+UVAUVB_58289.htm\">MDSolarSciences MD Creme Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a daily sunscreen that can help protect your skin after using retinol, Dr. Rogers suggests MDSolarSciences MD Creme Mineral Beauty Balm SPF 50. Formulated with natural mineral UV filters and anti-aging antioxidants like vitamins C and E, the lightweight formula can conceal imperfections, control shine and mattify the complexion. What\u2019s more? The daily sunscreen is recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation.</p>"},

Tattooing, with its underground roots as an outlaw trade, does not involve or require any kind of screened medical process or training, though it could be argued that the type of work is a cosmetic procedure as much as an artistic practice. That is not to say that tattoo shops do not take proper medical precautions for their services provided: all equipment is sterilized to medical standards and all used materials are disposed of according to proper biohazard regulations. However, tattooers are not trained in the same standardized way as medical students. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I spoke with dermatologist </span><a href=\"http://www.doctorrogers.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Heather Rogers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help bridge the gap between the doctor\u2019s office and the tattoo shop. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAs a physician, I always recommend caution and education before undergoing any elective procedure,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cSo, when proceeding, always do your research.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With her wealth of information provided, as well as my experiences working on the tattoo side of the divide, I have compiled a list of the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dos and don\u2019ts</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of tattoo care. Most of the basic list is agreed upon by each side of the conversation; however, the major division comes with the type of skin care product that facilitates the most efficient and beneficial healing process.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the process of getting tattooed, many foreign bodies are introduced into your skin, including several different types of ink and the petroleum jelly used during the tattoo application. Blood and plasma from your body also mix into the tattoo tools, which essentially fill your pores to the brim. Using hot water creates a larger opening in your pores, allowing for a smooth release of body and ink, which further hastens the healing process. Use a gentle, unscented cleanser to remove bacteria from your skin. Wash your new tattoo one to three times a day for the best results.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you undergo the cleaning process each day, opening your pores and allowing your tattoo to breathe, always use a flat and open palm to cleanse. Avoid rough scrubbing products such as a washcloths or loofahs as the coarse material can irritate your tattoo and disrupt the healing process. Using an open palm to scrub any of the excess clogging your pores as well as applying a mild soap to your fresh tattoo promotes a smooth and gentle healing for your skin. This handy method will also help avoid the biggest trigger word in any conversations concerning tattoo care: scabs.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider this the golden rule of any tattoo-care tips. This rule is set in stone (or skin, if you will). Unlike a scab on an everyday cut or scratch, a tattoo scab is built primarily of ink, thus picking the scab could lead to lighter spots of color (commonly called <em>holes</em>) in your tattoo once it is fully healed. Scabbing is, of course, natural to your body healing any kind of topical wound. However, the more you follow the first two tips in this list, the less your body will be prone to scabbing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After washing your tattoo with hot water and an open hand, it is then always recommended that one use some type of topical lotion to heal and moisturize your new work. This is where the conversation forks and where we elicit the help of Dr. Rogers. Every tattoo shop I have worked for generally promotes the usage petroleum-based healing ointments. Dr. Rogers finds the same suggestions in the dermatology community.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn my experience, many tattoo artists (like many dermatologists) recommend Aquaphor or over-the-counter antibiotic ointments during the healing process, things that commonly cause allergic reactions,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cOver-the-counter antibiotic ointments used to kill bacteria commonly found on the skin have been used for 40-plus years, [thus] most bacteria are resistant to them.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rogers attributes the promotion of petroleum-based products to a lack of awareness across disciplines about the ingredients within these products that can cause major allergic reactions and disruptions in the healing process for both tattoo and non-tattoo situations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Rogers has created a product that is both plant-based and hypoallergenic, pulling together the pros from both the bland, chemical-laden products on the shelf and their plant-based alternatives: </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Doctor+Rogers+RESTORE+Healing+Balm_74553.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RESTORE Healing Balm</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI made it because I was so frustrated by the number of allergenic reactions I was seeing from the ointments people were using after procedures,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cIt is all we use after surgeries and lasering in my dermatology practice, and many of my patients also use it to heal new tattoos.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, remember, before you get a tattoo, educate yourself and be very thorough when picking the design, picking the artist and picking the parlor\u2014but </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pick the final product. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Casey Mills considers himself an actor before a writer, yet he seems to have nearly triple the amount of writing credits.

That said, as we age, \u201cOur body\u2019s ability to heal itself continues to wane with skin turnover slowing down to over 60 days on our face,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. To combat this, Dr. Rogers suggests using \u201ca gentle chemical exfoliating cleanser with glycolic acid to remove some of the dry skin that builds up.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AHABHA+Exfoliating+Cleanser_53511.htm\">SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a daily cleanser in your 50s, Dr. Rogers suggests SkinMedica AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser. Formulated with a powerful combination of alpha and beta hydroxy acids that work to remove dry skin buildup and impurities, the daily cleanser can help diminish fine lines, brighten the look of the complexion and reduce hyperpigmentation with botanical extracts of bilberry and licorice. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there can be downsides to aging, there are also upsides. \u201cThe good news is, the penetration of topical ingredients is improved as our skin thins, so active proteins like growth factor and peptides can be more effective in stimulating corrective pathways in the skin that have slowed with age.\u201d In addition, Dr. Rogers suggests keeping an antioxidant serum in your daily routine, as the skin can become more prone to damage in this decade in life and beyond. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_TNS+Essential+Serum_16498.htm\">SkinMedica TNS Essential Serum</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another product to continue using in your 50s? Retinol. However, Dr. Rogers warns against using stronger formulas in your 50s and beyond. \u201cBecause our skin is thinner, it will absorb ingredients more easily that can irritate the skin,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cYou may need to cut back on your retinol or switch to a more gentle antioxidant,\u201d she adds. For this decade, Dr. Rogers suggests decreasing the strength from 0.5 to 0.25. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Age+Defense+Retinol+Complex+25_55450.htm\">SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex .25</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking for the best retinol for your 50s? Dr. Rogers suggests SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex. Formulated with .25% retinol and magnolia-bark extract, the anti-aging skin care product works to rejuvenate the skin\u2019s texture and tone, fight signs of aging, soothes inflammation and more. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our 50s and 60s, our skin not only starts to become thinner but drier, too. \u201cSkin continues to thin, making it dry, more sensitive and easily damaged,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. With that in mind, Dr. Rogers says to turn the volume up on moisture, as face cream can act as a barrier to protect the skin. \u201cLook for products made with oils like jojoba or castor seed in their protective and emollient qualities, and humectants like glycerin and hyaluronic acid that can pull water back to your skin,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cThe thicker, the better,\u201d she adds.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Doctor+Rogers+RESTORE+Healing+Balm_74553.htm\">Doctor Rogers RESTORE\u2122 Healing Balm </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another area to focus on in your 50s? Your eyes. Because the skin starts to appear more dry and crepey, it is important to keep the skin around the eye contour as hydrated as possible, starting with an eye cream. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Lumiere+Riche+BioRestorative+Eye+Balm_33301.htm\">NeoCutis Lumiere Riche Bio-Restorative Eye Balm </a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an eye cream that can nourish the eye contour and help keep signs of aging at bay, Dr. Rogers suggests NeoCutis Lumiere Riche Bio-Restorative Eye Balm. Formulated with caffeine, wild yam extract and other soothing ingredients, the anti-aging eye salve can reduce the look of puffiness, improve firmness, help to accelerate cellular repair and protect against skin damage. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like cleanser and moisturizer, sunscreen is a staple at any age. That said, with the threat of sun damage and skin cancer in your 50s, there\u2019s no time like the present to get serious about sunscreen. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AGE+Smart+Dynamic+Skin+Recovery+SPF+50_12295.htm\">Dermalogica AGE Smart Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50\u00a0</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for a sunscreen for this age, Dermalogica AGE Smart Dynamic Skin Recovery SPF 50 is a good choice. Aside from broad-spectrum sun protection, this sunscreen also offers anti-aging benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On top your cleanser, you may want to consider using a gentle chemical exfoliant once or twice a week, whether that\u2019s in the form of cream, mask or peel. \u201cThe slower turnover of the skin may require adding in a gentle chemical exfoliant to get a top layer of dead skin off,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. In addition, exfoliating the skin can help anti-aging products better penetrate the skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Resurface+High+Potency+Cream++20+Bionic+AHA_9751.htm\">NeoStrata High Potency Cream</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a gentle\u2014yet, effective\u2014facial exfoliant, Dr. Rogers suggests NeoStrata\u2019s High Potency Cream. Formulated with antioxidant-rich lactobionic acid and vitamin E, as well as 18% glycolic acid, the anti-aging facial exfoliant works to chemically remove dead skin cells, fortify the complexion, replenish moisture, improve collagen production and nourish and protect the complexion. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another must-try product for your 50s? Eyelash and brow conditioner. As we age, \u201chair growth\u2014including, eyelashes and eyebrows\u2014begins to slow down,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. So, adding a specific product that can help with this repercussion can promote longer, fuller, more youthful-looking eyelashes and brows. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_VLumine+Lash+Serum_69062.htm\">Revitalash V\u2019Lumine Lash Serum</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For eyelash conditioner, Dr. Rogers suggests Revitalash V\u2019Lumine Lash Serum. Rich in nutrients like sugar beet betaine, ginger, lavender, aloe and biotin, the lash-enhancing serum works to fortify lashes and improve the look of elasticity and shine. In addition, it can strengthen the hair and give lashes more volume than before.</span></p>"},

What about dry, frizzy, unmanageable hair (aka, bedhead)? Sleep lines? We hate to break it to you, but your pillow\u2014more specifically, its case\u2014may be to blame for these beauty woes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fancy yourself a cotton pillowcase, you\u2019re going to want to hear us out. Thanks to its absorbent capabilities, cotton pillowcases can reverse your beauty efforts and wreak havoc on both your hair and skin. Curious to know more? We share the scary truth about pillows, plus how to combat their anti-beauty efforts, up ahead. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way cotton pillows destroy your skin overtime? By creating the perfect environment for premature wrinkles to form. According to board-certified dermatologist, </span><a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cCotton pillows crunch the collagen and make sleep lines on your face.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Solution: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a solution, Dr. Jaliman suggests switching to a silk pillowcase, such as the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Queen+Pure+Silk+Pillowcase++Peach_69245.htm\">slip Pure Silk Pillowcase</a>, as it can allow your face to slide against the pillow and decrease your chances of pillow-induced wrinkles and sleep lines. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem with cotton pillowcases? \u201cThey suck moisture out of your skin,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. And, \u201cWhen your skin is dry, wrinkles and fine lines tend to appear more exaggerated,\u201d she adds. Not to mention: dry skin can be super uncomfortable and make it harder for your skin to absorb skin care products. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to stealing moisture from your skin and hair, cotton pillows also absorb your beauty products, stealing whatever benefit you\u2019re hoping to get from your serums and night creams.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Solution: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another reason to switch out your cotton pillowcase for a pillowcase made from 100% pure silk. Unlike cotton, silk won\u2019t suck moisture and product out of your hair or skin and leave you with silky soft skin and hair come morning. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to soaking up moisture and your hair care products, cotton pillowcases can also create friction between your hair while you sleep. Resulting in lots of frizz and sometimes even breakage\u2014especially if you pull your strands back at night. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Solution: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to avoid pillow-induced frizz and breakage, one way to solve this is by using a silk pillowcase or wrapping your strands in a 100% silk scarf. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think the fluffiness of your pillow doesn\u2019t matter, think again. Silk or not, flat pillows can result in puffier, more tired-looking eyes come morning, as fluid gathers around the eyes when you sleep. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Solution: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to adopting a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Pure+Silk+Sleep+Mask++Pink_66744.htm\">silk sleeping mask</a> into your routine, you may also want to elevate your pillow and start <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/health-beauty-benefits-of-sleeping-on-your-back/\">sleeping on your back</a>. Sleeping on a flat pillow can cause fluid to build up around the under-eye area and create puffy bags. By elevating your pillow and sleeping on your back, you can promote better drainage. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way your pillow can wreak havoc on your beauty? It can cause breakouts. That\u2019s right. Even if you wash your face every night, the dirt from your hair, sweat and other debris can take up residency on your pillowcase and cause your skin to break out. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Solution: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to reduce pillow-induced breakouts is to wash your pillowcase regularly\u2014especially if you have oily, acne-prone skin, or oily hair. Washing your pillowcase at least one to two times a week can rid the fabric from pore-clogging dirt and debris that cause breakouts to form. </span></p>"},

Some appear to be unlikely heroes at first but have since gone on to prove that they truly are skin care powerhouses (like\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">coconut oil</a>, for example). Probiotics belong to that category of ingredients that may raise some eyebrows or prompt a little uneasiness. After all, slathering your face with live bacteria doesn\u2019t exactly sound appealing or comforting. (Fun fact: Millions of microscopic bacteria already call your body home.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of what people know about probiotics come from yogurt commercials\u2014they\u2019re the \u201cfriendly\u201d bacteria that make sure your gut stays healthy, balanced and toxin-free and your immune system remains in top form. But what exactly are probiotics, and more important, are they really good for your skin?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cProbiotics are micro-organisms that restore good bacteria to the digestive tract,\u201d says registered nutritionist and dietician <a href=\"https://www.bewellbyak.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alana Kessler</a>. \u201cThey can be found in supplement forms such as powders or pills and in fermented foods like kefir, cultured vegetables like sauerkraut and miso, fermented soybeans, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/yogurt-skin-benefits/\">yogurt</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar-for-skin/\">apple cider vinegar</a> and raw cheese.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThere are numerous strands of probiotics that are beneficial to our health. The most common groups are called <em>lactobacillus </em>(lactic acid) and <em>Bifidobacterium,</em>\u201d adds registered nurse <a href=\"http://www.remediesforme.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Rebecca Lee</a>. Lactic acid is known for its anti-aging and anti-acne benefits while <em>bifidobacterium</em> plays a key role in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5031164/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">strengthening the immune system</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the 1930s, experts have been positing <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3038963/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the gut-brain-skin axis theory</a>, believing that a person\u2019s emotional state\u2014whether it\u2019s anxiety, stress or depression\u2014can alter the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and cause bad or unhealthy bacteria to build up. This, in turn, causes inflammation that leads to breakouts and flare-ups for those with skin conditions like rosacea, acne or eczema. Hence, the importance of keeping probiotics in your diet.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cProbiotics aid in creating a healthy gut, so there is less toxicity being reabsorbed into the bloodstream,\u201d shares Kessler. \u201cToxins inhibit the absorption of important vitamins, minerals and nutrients and interfere with the body\u2019s ability to rid itself of necessary waste, causing inflammation.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When applied topically, probiotics have also been found to provide numerous benefits. \u201cLike dietary probiotics impact your stomach\u2019s biome, probiotic skin care products try to promote a healthy skin biome by influencing the types of bacteria that live on your skin,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.janetprystowskymd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> Janet Prystowsky, M.D.</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the known benefits of probiotics on skin and hair are:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing probiotic supplements, naturopathic physician <a href=\"http://northcountynaturalmedicine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heather Sandison, N.D.</a>, says it\u2019s always best to get a stool test \u201cto determine the right bugs to balance\u201d as each person has a unique gut microbiome. \u201cThe right balance of probiotics in your gut help you to digest and assimilate nutrients so that your hair, skin and nails have the nutrients they need to look and feel healthy,\u201d Dr. Sandison adds. \u201cFor best results, I recommend rotating high-quality, high-dose probiotics both topically and orally.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consistency is also important, says Kessler, and so is choosing products that have at least two strands of probiotics. She recommends doubling up on the dosage should you experience flare-ups in your digestion or skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cOur bodies have millions of normal, healthy bacteria. When these bacterial colonies are growing and inhabiting the GI system, skin, mouth and body, they prevent \u2018bad bacteria\u2019 and fungi from taking over. That is the key.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-skin-fatigue/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">Skin Fatigue: What Is It and How Do You Know If You Have It?</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Janeca Racho \u00b7 February 20, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this fast-paced and ever-changing world, sometimes you have to make sacrifices and take less-than-ideal shortcuts just to cope and keep up with the demands of daily life. Aside from the obvious toll that these take on your mind and body, unhealthy lifestyle choices\u2014and other external irritants that you encounter daily\u2014can also lead to another frequently experienced but not often discussed skin concern. We\u2019re talking about skin fatigue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To further understand what skin fatigue is, Dermstore talked to Nicolas Travis, founder of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Allies+of+Skin_504813.htm\">Allies of Skin</a>\u2014a Singapore-born skin care brand that sets itself apart with its adaptogenic range (more on this later) of products that fit seamlessly into the high-velocity lives of ultra-busy multi-hyphenates. As both chemist and originator of his skin care line, Travis himself leads a hectic lifestyle and knows all too well that highly stressful environments, frequent traveling and long workdays can only lead to tired and troubled skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Travis, skin fatigue is mainly caused by a combination of lifestyle- and stress-related factors\u2014like lack of sleep and exercise, smoking and unhealthy diet, to name a few\u2014as well as environmental aggressors like pollution and sun exposure. When under constant stress, your adrenal glands release the stress hormone cortisol that, in turn, affects blood flow throughout the body and damages the collagen in your skin. This accelerates the aging process and hinders your skin\u2019s ability to repair itself, resulting to skin fatigue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe main indicators of skin fatigue are dullness, large pores and persistent dryness. Fatigued skin also doesn\u2019t reflect light well, so skin looks generally tired,\u201d explains Travis. \u201cIf you find your skin looking sallow, feeling more parched than usual and no longer responding to the products you\u2019ve been using, your skin is most probably fatigued.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To effectively fight back against skin fatigue, it\u2019s important to know where and how to start. Below, Travis shares everything you need to know about skin fatigue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the largest organ in the body, the skin is your first line of defense against external damage, so it\u2019s naturally important to always keep it in fighting shape, particularly its delicate barrier. \u201cWhen the skin barrier is healthy, skin retains moisture and nutrients better,\u201d says Travis. \u201cWhen it is compromised, problems beyond the superficial will start surfacing.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, when signs of fatigue start to become more pronounced, it\u2019s your skin\u2019s call to action, alerting you of potential concerns that you might have unintentionally ignored.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who are frequently exposed to smoke from cigarettes and pollution, travel often and live in the city are more likely to develop skin fatigue, says Travis. \u201cSmoking depletes the body\u2019s natural supply of antioxidants, while pollution and smog from large cities can cause damage to the skin\u2019s barrier over time. Signs of fatigue become more obvious starting in the late twenties,\u201d he adds.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Putting your Netflix subscription to good use may sound like a good way to de-stress, but if you want to be kinder to your skin, consider having <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/sleep-and-skin/\">a good night\u2019 sleep</a>\u00a0instead. \u201cEven if it\u2019s just an extra 30 minutes every day, it adds up,\u201d says Travis. Squeezing in a regular workout routine will also help in boosting essential circulation and in strengthening your immunity.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way you can fight off the signs of skin fatigue, premature aging and acne is by reducing inflammation, and Travis says this can be easily done by incorporating essential fatty acids into your diet (from wild salmon and avocado, for example). \u201cI\u2019m a fan of fish oil and blackcurrant oil supplements for overall skin health and resveratrol, pterostilbene and vitamin C for antioxidant protection,\u201d he shares.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Antioxidants</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">retinol</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are your skin\u2019s best allies,\u201d says Travis. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/antioxidants-for-skin-care/\">Antioxidants</a> work by protecting the skin from oxidative stress caused by free radicals and are known for their anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits. As for <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">retinol</a>, Travis says it\u2019s \u201cone of the best things you can use on your skin.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt treats acne, pigmentation and wrinkles, speeds up cell renewal and refines large pores so skin looks less tired and more radiant,\u201d he explains. But if you\u2019re wary of known retinol side effects, Travis suggests looking into encapsulated retinol as they are \u201cnext-generation versions that give all the benefits without any of the traditional irritation or dryness.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other ingredients to look for in your skin care products include l-ascorbic acid (<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a>), resveratrol, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\">niacinamide</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a> and nutrient-dense oils like argan, rosehip and acai oils, adds Travis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a nutshell,</span> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-of-adaptogens-skin-care/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">adaptogens</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are herbs that reverse and reduce fatigue and the toxic effects of stress on the body. They get their name from their ability to adapt to the body\u2019s needs and to respond to constantly changing stressors that you encounter in your daily life.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThey boost the body\u2019s natural defenses and keep it in a state of healthy equilibrium,\u201d says Travis. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the same concept that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Allies+of+Skin_504813.htm\">Allies of Skin</a> has successfully applied into its adaptogenic skin care line. The brand combines research-backed, tried-and-tested adaptogens like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/moringa-skin-benefits/\">moringa</a>\u00a0a</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nd licorice-root extract with antioxidant powerhouses like glutathione and vitamins C and E to create products that work in synergy with your skin to address its specific needs while complementing your demanding lifestyle.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis two-pronged approach ensures that all boxes are checked. They also have the added benefit of symbiosis as glutathione recycles vitamin C and prolongs its potency,\u201d Travis adds. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That said, Allies of Skin\u2019s products\u00a0\u201cfunction as nutrient reservoirs for the skin, supplementing the skin with all the nutrients it needs to regenerate and repair itself,\u201d shares Travis. Much like a multi-vitamin, these products intuitively provide necessary boost and protection based on the needs and condition of your skin. \u201cIf your skin is dehydrated, the hydrators and moisture magnets will be activated. If you are in a polluted city, the antioxidants will kick in to protect from free radical damage,\u201d explains Travis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brand\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_1A+AllDay+Mask_73737.htm\">1A All-Day Mask</a> is the world\u2019s first-day mask that\u2019s designed to simulate the benefits of a good night\u2019s sleep, featuring a leave-on formula that reduces puffiness and creates a protective barrier against smoke and pollution. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_1A+Overnight+Mask_73733.htm\">1A Overnight Mask</a> is an overnight peel that contains the patented Ally-R\u2122, a stabilized form of retinol that encourages cell renewal and rejuvenates tired skin with essential fatty acids and trace nutrients. \u201cIt repairs fatigued skin overnight\u2014all you have to do is sleep,\u201d adds Travis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n            <script>\n            $(document).ready(function () {\n                $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n            });\n            </script>\n        </p>"},

It could be a hormone-triggered type of hyperpigmentation commonly known as \u201cthe mask of pregnancy,\u201d or melasma. The good news? It can be treated with in-office treatments and home remedies in the form of powerful skin care products. Curious to know more? We tapped one of Dr. Oz\u2019s favorite dermatologists to find out what causes melasma, how to tell if you have hormonal hyperpigmentation, how to get rid of it and more. See our dermatologist\u2019s guide to melasma, ahead!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/skin-care-while-pregnant/\">referred to as pregnancy mask</a>, \u201cmelasma is a condition caused by hormonal change from pregnancy or hormonal treatments, such as birth control,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.drdendyengelman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Dendy Engelman</a>, MD, FACMS, FASDS, FAAD. \u201cIt usually appears in patches on the face\u2014forehead and upper lip are sites of predilection\u2014and it\u2019s more likely in women than men,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe hormonal changes from birth control can trigger melasma by stimulating the melanocytes to produce melanin pigment,\u201d says Dr. Engelman. That said, just because someone takes birth control doesn\u2019t mean they will experience hyperpigmentation. \u201cNot everyone on birth control will get melasma, some are more prone than others,\u201d adds Dr. Engelman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wondering how to tell if you have melasma? While a dermatologist can best determine whether or not it\u2019s actually the mask of pregnancy, knowing what it looks like can also help. \u201cMelasma is patchy, with more distinct patterns,\u201d says Dr. Engelman. \u201cIt can also appear gray\u2014unlike freckles or sunspots, which are brown in color,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you notice these dark patches on the skin, you may want to book an appointment with your dermatologist to \u201cmake sure this is what you have and strategize a treatment plan,\u201d says Dr. Engelman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One key thing to consider? Sun exposure. \u201cHyperpigmentation is caused when melanin\u2014what gives our hair and skin color\u2014is overproduced in certain spots on the skin,\u201d says Dr. Engelman. \u201cMelanin goes into overproduction in the sun to protect our skin from harmful UV rays, causing them to look darker than your natural skin tone,\u201d she adds. \u201cExposure to the sun makes the issue worse,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the sun\u2019s UV rays, Dr. Engelman warns against using products with salicylic acid, as it can have a damaging effect on melasma-ridden skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On top of that, your diet may also have an effect on melasma. \u201cIt has been reported that avoiding certain foods with high estrogen content\u2014e.g. dried fruit, chickpeas, tofu, soy and multigrain bread\u2014will help limit or correct melasma,\u201d says Dr. Engelman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While melasma can be frustrating, there are some home remedies that can help fade dark patches. Furthermore, \u201cin-office procedures like IPL and Pulsed Dye Laser treatment (PDL) will reduce symptoms,\u201d says Dr. Engelman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those looking to reduce the look of melasma at home, Dr. Engelman recommends the following:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Engelman\u2019s top choice for helping to reduce signs of melasma? Sunscreen. \u201cThe safest sun protection to use is physical [sunscreen] made with either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide,\u201d she says. As previously mentioned, melasma-ridden skin can be ultra-sensitive to sunlight, as the UV rays cause the skin to go into melanin overdrive. Applying (and reapplying) sunscreen daily can help keep hyperpigmentation from worsening.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Clear+BroadSpectrum+SPF+46_20567.htm\">EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46\u00a0</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your search for a physical sunscreen enriched with zinc oxide ends here. Formulated with hyaluronic and lactic acid, EltaMD\u2019s UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 doesn\u2019t just create a barrier between your skin and the sun\u2019s UV rays, it can help moisturize and protect the complexion, too. Not to mention: Its oil-free formula makes it ideal for everyday use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another home remedy for melasma? Glycolic acid. \u201cGlycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid that is safe during pregnancy,\u201d says Dr. Engelman. \u201cGlycolic acid is great for combating the hyperpigmentation that can occur from the hormonal surges [during] pregnancy, called chloasma,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Skin+Illuminating+Retexturizing+Pads_66625.htm\"><strong>Elizabeth Arden Skin Illuminating Retexturizing Pads</strong></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWhen I was pregnant, I used Elizabeth Arden\u2019s Retexturizing Pads with 5% glycolic acid,\u201d says Dr. Engelman. \u201cI would often wash with a gentle cleanser, then use these as a \u2018treatment toner\u2019 two to three times a week,\u201d she adds. Formulated with citrus extracts that promote radiant skin, the brightening treatment not only helps with signs of melasma, it can also work to retexture the skin and promote a more youthful-looking appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While exfoliation can be an excellent way to promote softer, smoother skin in your weekly or bi-weekly skin care regimen, it can also have a positive effect on hyperpigmentation. Dr. Engelman suggests incorporating <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/exfoliation-definition-and-benefits/\">a chemical or physical exfoliant</a> to help fade and lighten dark patches on skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Strawberry+Rhubarb+Dermafoliant_27506.htm\">\u00c9minence Organics Strawberry Rhubarb Dermafoliant</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another product to look for when treating melasma at home? <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-best-serums-to-try-for-brighter-skin/\">Brightening serums</a>. If you want more and brighter-looking skin, brightening serums can do just that. One thing to keep in mind is that, \u201cgenerally, it takes about two to four weeks to see effects,\u201d says Jeanette Jackninm, MD. \u201cI would use a brightening serum twice a day, in the morning before applying\u00a0an SPF 30 sunscreen and at night. Just be consistent, and remember to back down if your skin gets irritated, red, too white or blotchy,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_SkinCeuticals+Discoloration+Defense_75145.htm\">SkinCeuticals Discoloration Defense</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Featuring tried-and-tested depigmenting ingredients niacinamide, kojic acid, hydroxyethylpiperazine ethane sulfonic acid (HEPES) and tranexamic acid (TXA), this clinically proven brightening treatment <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skinceuticals-discoloration-defense/\">tackles hyperpigmentation from all angles</a>: inhibiting pigment-producing enzymes (tyrosinase), disrupting melanin transfer and exfoliation.</p>"},

They can cause dry skin. \u201cSeasonal allergies can affect your skin by making it red, dry and flaky,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cThis is a result of the body trying to ward off irritants, such as pollen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those who experience dry skin caused by allergies, consider switching out some of your staple products\u2014like cleanser\u2014for <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-face-washes-for-dry-skin/\">more hydrating options</a> that gently purify your skin without irritating it.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0PCA Skin Creamy Cleanser\u00a0</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Virtually any cause of inflammation to the eye area may manifest as eyelid swelling or puffy eyes, although allergic reactions are likely the most common cause. With allergic reactions, the eyes may also be red and\u00a0itchy\u00a0as well as swollen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To counter this, Dr. Jaliman suggests \u201cusing an eye cream with caffeine, hyaluronic acid and green tea,\u201d as they can help with the puffiness and dark circles that occur when it\u2019s allergy season.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Water+Drench+Hyaluronic+Cloud+HydraGel+Eye+Patches_73273.htm\">Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Hydra-Gel Eye Patches</a></b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another way to ease congestion and allergy symptoms is by treating it from the inside.

According to the <a href=\"https://www.sleepassociation.org/sleep/sleep-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sleep Foundation</a>, up to 70 million American adults struggle with a sleep disorder\u2014from insomnia to sleep apnea and more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While pulling an occasional all-nighter isn\u2019t so bad, constantly depriving yourself of sleep can put your body in a constant state of stress.\u00a0Sleep deprivation, according to\u00a0plastic surgeon and dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.aafprs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Mary Lynn Moran, MD</a>, causes an elevation of cortisol, the stress hormone, interfering with our bodies\u2019 ability to mend itself overnight.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the body\u2019s largest organ, skin is usually where the first signs of damage appears, and we\u2019re not just talking about dark circles and eye bags. Here are just some of the ways insufficient sleep can wreak havoc on your appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Moran says that when we don\u2019t log away those hours with the sandman, our aging process is accelerated, leading to visible wrinkles in a shorter period of time. She notes that several studies have demonstrated that women who are deprived of sleep have more wrinkles, dehydrated skin, large pores, increased redness and increased dark circles under their eyes. \u201cOur cells regenerate while we sleep, so if we don\u2019t get good quality sleep, they are unable to repair themselves, leaving us looking older,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The position of how you sleep can make a difference in your skin\u2019s youth, too. Dr. Moran says <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/health-beauty-benefits-of-sleeping-on-your-back/\">side sleeping can result in deeper wrinkles</a>: \u201cI often see wrinkles that are greater on one side compared to the other and that is usually a sign that the patient sleeps on that side. Wrinkles that aren\u2019t in the normal places or orientation that you would expect from repetitive movement are usually from sleeping as well,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the only way you can get comfortable is to nod off on your side, dermatologist Dr. Alan Levy recommends investing in <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/pillow-ruins-skin-hair/\">silk pillowcases</a> to avoid sleep lines and to keep your skin healthy and smooth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As blissful as it would be to no longer have to deal with acne or blackheads past a certain age, many people battle skin woes for a large portion of their life. If you\u2019re trying to ward away these pesky pimples, though, Dr. Levy says getting a great night\u2019s rest is an important step in your routine. \u201cPoor sleep has been associated with immune dysregulation and inflammation in the skin which leads to dryness, redness and breakouts. The more inflammation in the skin, the less glow your face will have,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, if you\u2019re someone who battles acne, psoriasis, rosacea, eczema and other inflammatory disorders,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.metropolitaninstitute.com/our-doctors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dermatologist Dr. Jennifer M. Segal, M.D.</a>, says it\u2019s much more important for you to earn those eight hours of rest each night. A lack of sleep can usually heighten your levels of anxiety, and in return, infuriate breakouts. \u201cIt is important to maintain healthy sleep, exercise and eating habits in addition to medical therapies for these conditions,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from hormones, diet and illness, Dr. Segal explains that our lifestyle habits can also affect the quality\u00a0<em>and</em>\u00a0quantity of our hair. Because lack of sleep can mimic our bodies\u2019 response to stress, it can result in \u201ctelogen effluvium, a non-permanent hair loss that can occur after an event that puts stress on the body, including pregnancy, illness or a stressful life event,\u201d she shares.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Everyone has evenings during which one too many cocktails at happy hour or one baby who refused to go to sleep created a stressful, sleepless night. But as much as you can, Dr. Levy stresses the importance of maintaining a pre-bedtime routine to help your skin repair itself while you sleep. The first, most important step to keep your pores fresh, clean and healthy? Washing your face. \u201cNot washing your makeup off before bed can cause pores to get clogged and ultimately lead to breakouts,\u201d he says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need more tips on how to create the perfect sleeping environment for your skin?

But recent studies suggest that the stimulant isn\u2019t all bad. On the contrary, caffeine might even benefit your body <em>and</em> your skin, whether you drink it with cream and sugar or<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Caffeine_503552.htm\"> apply it topically to your skin</a>. Still, we\u2019re a bit hesitant, so we asked some experts to weigh in on these claims.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Facts:</strong>\u00a0A January 2015 study published in the <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/107/2/djv013/906098\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JNCI: Journal of the National Cancer Institute</a> found that those who consumed four cups of coffee or more per day had a 20-percent lower risk for developing malignant melanoma than those who drank less coffee. During the study, Erikka Loftfield, M.P.H., a fellow at the National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, followed more than 400,000 adults ages 50 to 71 years for an average of 10 years. Participants were asked to report typical coffee intake. \u201cDuring the course of follow-up, nearly 3,000 cases of malignant melanoma occurred,\u201d she shares. \u201cGiven the large size of our cohort and large number of melanoma cases, we had good statistical power to find that higher coffee drinking was associated with lower risk of melanoma.\u201d According to Loftfield\u2019s findings, the decreased risk appears to exist with caffeinated coffee consumption. \u201cSince the majority of coffee drinkers in our study primarily drank caffeinated coffee, we had better statistical power to detect an association for caffeinated than for decaffeinated coffee drinking.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While this is obviously good news for coffee addicts, Loftfield notes that further study is still required to determine an official link. And whether or not the potent antioxidant properties of caffeine are enough to ward off cancer-causing UV rays, nothing beats avoiding the sun at peak hours and applying broad-spectrum sunscreen every two hours.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Facts:</strong>\u00a0Ever since beauty editors suggested that exfoliating with fresh coffee grounds could reduce the appearance of cellulite, topical caffeine skin care products have soared in popularity. According to them, topical applications of caffeine can temporarily constrict blood vessels, giving skin a firmer appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But some experts believe these results are temporary if present at all. \u201cCaffeine as a topical ingredient isn\u2019t bad for your skin, but there is no clinical proof of its effectiveness when it comes to improving the look of cellulite or stretch marks,\u201d shares Dr. Ronald L. Moy, leading Los Angeles cosmetic and plastic surgeon and former president of the American Academy of Dermatology. \u201cWe have a better chance of reducing the appearance of cellulite or even the signs of acne when we stimulate stem cells, and there\u2019s scientific evidence to support that,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Facts:\u00a0</strong>Sadly, multiple cups of coffee or tea throughout the day won\u2019t reduce the appearance of wrinkles. \u201cThere is no evidence that drinking caffeinated beverages can improve your skin or counter the signs of aging,\u201d shares Jennifer Krohn, a Los Angeles-based registered dietitian.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But according to New York-based dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon Dr. Kavita Mariwalla, you might have better luck with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Caffeine_503552.htm\">caffeine in skin care products</a>\u2014at least when it comes to preventing the initial onset of wrinkles. \u201cCaffeine is a strong antioxidant,\u201d she shares. \u201cThis is good because it helps protect the skin against damage from UV radiation and slows down the process of aging caused by sun exposure.\u201d While it\u2019s unlikely that these products will smooth existing fine lines, they may provide a helpful ounce of prevention.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Facts:</strong>\u00a0Yes, caffeine is a known diuretic that can send your bladder into overdrive, but it doesn\u2019t promote the release of toxins. \u201cYou won\u2019t really flush out toxins. Our kidneys and livers are good at doing that, but no real food or beverage really acts in that way,\u201d notes Krohn. It is true that you may shed some water weight when consuming caffeinated beverages or supplements, but Krohn says the effect is minimal. \u201cDiuretics will cause some loss of water weight, as is their nature, but the extent you lose from caffeine alone is pretty insignificant.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>The Facts:\u00a0</strong>Caffeinated eye creams can perk up eyes, but the results are usually short-lived. This means that if you\u2019re using a caffeine-infused eye treatment, you may have to use it every day to get the results you want. \u201cCaffeine is soothing, anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive, which can decrease redness and puffiness,\u201d explains certified clinical and research dermatologist Dr. Jeannette Graf. By narrowing blood vessels and calming skin, caffeine can temporarily reduce under-eye bags.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Caffeine can also wake up tired eyes by reducing the appearance of dark circles, informs Dr. Mariwalla. \u201cCaffeine helps the microcirculation of blood in the skin, which is why it also helps decrease brown discoloration underneath the eyes, but only over the short term,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-eye-creams-dark-circles-bags-wrinkles/\">Eye creams</a> can come in handy, but are tea bags just as effective in calming under-eye puffiness? The answer is yes, but not entirely because of their caffeine content. \u201cThis is mainly because of the tannins found in tea, and, again, the effect is short term,\u201d says Dr. Mariwalla. Tannins are known to tighten skin and reduce inflammation. Just remember to let the tea bags cool first or this DIY solution is anything but soothing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>READERS\u2014What do you think of\u00a0this article?

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/is-lanolin-safe/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">Dermatologist Answers: Is Lanolin Good or Bad for Your Skin?</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Dr. Heather D. Rogers \u00b7 March 12, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lanolin has long been used in the skin care and cosmetics industry as an effective emollient, commonly used in body creams and lotions to lock in much-needed moisture and prevent water loss. But lanolin also has a bad rep for irritating sensitive skin and causing allergic reactions. So what\u2019s the real story behind lanolin?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lanolin is a greasy yellow substance made from secretions (sebum) from the skin glands of sheep to condition their wool. It is a natural, animal-derived product harvested from shorn wool. Unrefined lanolin has been used for thousands of years by various cultures, and refined lanolin has been used for more than a hundred of years in ointments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lanolin is a long-chain waxy ester that contains cholesterol, but with a different composition than human sebum. There are two common forms: lanolin and lanolin alcohol. The latter, the one that\u2019s more commonly used in skin care, adds a molecule to provide a smoother skin feel. Because of its high fat content, lanolin is occlusive, meaning it prevents the evaporation of water from the skin (transepidermal water loss). This keeps skin moisturized and helps the skin heal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lanolin is generally considered safe for intact skin. However, ointments and occlusive products are designed to be used on <em>healing</em> skin, not normal and intact skin. This is the trouble with lanolin. Despite being a common ingredient in a number of products marketed to help heal eczema, burns, scrapes, raw nipples and post-procedure skin, the incidence of lanolin allergy is rapidly increasing. For example, a recent study of more than 1,000 children with eczema found that 66% of them reacted to lanolin alcohol (1). Another study looking at allergic reactions in patients with chronic wounds found 11% reacted to lanolin (2).\u00a0 Lanolin is not what our skin needs when it is trying to heal!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rapidly rising incidence of lanolin allergy is thought to be related to increased exposure to lanolin. This is not surprising given how ubiquitous it has become in skin care products. The public and health care professionals need to be educated about the increasing allergy to lanolin as many pediatricians, dermatologists and plastic surgeons continue to recommend lanolin-containing products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are many other ingredients that can replace lanolin to prevent transepidermal water loss. The cheapest options are petroleum jelly (Vaseline), mineral oil and paraffin. All are hypoallergenic but made from the hydrocarbons of fossil fuels (which also have bad reps).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want a more natural option, try something with beeswax, or plant-based ingredients like vegetable waxes and hydrogenated plant oils, which is a key ingredient in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Doctor+Rogers+RESTORE+Healing+Balm_74553.htm\">RESTORE Healing Balm.</a>\u00a0Made from 100% plant-based ingredients, this soothing balm soothes and protects skin and alleviates eczema symptoms, dryness, chapped lips, burns, scrapes and more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hope this answers your questions on lanolin. Until next time!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Warmly,</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heather D.

To state the obvious: That\u2019s because a lot of what we eat can also have <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-foods-you-didnt-know-are-great-for-your-skin/\">major benefits to our skin</a>. Case in point? A superfood known as spirulina. Made popular by dietary supplements and smoothie powders, spirulina has quickly made its way into some of the most effective skin care products\u2014and with good reason.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Paula Simpson, holistic nutritionist, biochemist and Co-Founder of <a href=\"http://www.zss-skincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zea Skin Solutions</a>, \u201cThe most common species of blue-green algae found in supplements are from the Arthrospira genus (collectively referred to as spirulina).\u201d And the reason the so-called superfood is used in health and beauty formulas is not just because of its green color\u2014though that is a result of its powerful components\u2014it\u2019s because the blue-green algae \u201cprovides a rich source of nutrients, including protein, complex carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins A, E K, beta-carotene and B-complex,\u201d notes Simpson.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, spirulina contains a variety of beauty (and health) benefiting minerals and free fatty acids, such as \u201ciron, manganese, zinc, sodium, potassium, magnesium, copper and gamma-linolenic acid,\u201d she adds. On top of all that, spirulina can be a great source of antioxidants and has the ability to detox the body thanks to its chlorophyll and carotenes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That said, you don\u2019t have to plug your nose and down a green smoothie to reap the beauty benefits of spirulina. Take a look at some of our favorite products formulated with the superfood ahead and how it can help your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                    <script>\n                        $(document).ready(function () {\n                            $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n                        });\n                    </script>\n                </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most standout reasons to use spirulina in your beauty routine? According to board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, spirulina is rich in antioxidants that can help defend your skin and body from free radicals. \u201cIt neutralizes free radicals and other toxins that cause premature signs of aging,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Oxygen+Complex_73350.htm?keyword=73350\">Natura Bisse Oxygen Complex </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This anti-aging facial serum uses a combined force of spirulina, hydrogen peroxide, living water and pure, encapsulated oxygen to provide the complexion with a burst of hydration and essential vitamins and minerals. Not to mention, it reveals a brighter, more purified complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to neutralizing free radicals with antioxidants, spirulina has anti-inflammatory properties that can also slow down signs of aging. \u201cSome studies report that spirulina provides strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cBoth of which are leading drivers for reversing skin aging,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Firmarine+Face+Bar_68115.htm?keyword=68115\">Erno Laszlo Firmarine Face Bar </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Washing your face is a key part of keeping environmental aggressors\u2014such as pollution, dirt and other debris\u2014at bay. And a spirulina-infused cleansing bar is an effective way to do so. Erno Laszlo\u2019s Firmarine Face Bar utilizes spirulina\u2019s anti-aging benefits to rid the skin of pollutants, strengthen the skin\u2019s elasticity, boost collagen production and leave the skin looking and feeling ultra-cleansed and refreshed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spirulina also has detoxifying properties that can be put to good use in skin care. \u201cChlorophyll provides strong chelating properties,\u201d says Simpson. \u201cIt attracts and removes heavy metals from the body before they reach and get stored in skin tissue,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Purifying+Seaweed+Clay+Mask_71811.htm?keyword=71811\">The Organic Pharmacy Purifying Seaweed Clay Mask </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the best ways to reap the detoxifying benefits of spirulina? Through a nutrient-rich face mask. The Organic Pharmacy\u2019s Purifying Seaweed Clay Mask utilizes the beauty benefits of seaweed and blue-algae along with other key ingredients (such as aloe vera, salicylic acid and vitamin C) to detox pores, exfoliate dead skin, boost elasticity and provide the skin with a shield of anti-aging nutrients that can protect against various environmental aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not only can spirulina neutralize free radicals and protect against early signs of aging, it can firm the look of sagging skin, too. \u201cWith a good amino acid profile, including chief constituents for skin collagen\u2014glycine and proline\u2014and mineral copper, spirulina is a great option to support skin collagen production,\u201d says Simpson.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: \u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sea+Greens+Body+Butter_73228.htm?keyword=73228\">H2O+ Beauty Sea Greens Body Butter</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a body butter that can help anti-age and firm the look of skin, reach for H2O+ Beauty\u2019s Sea Greens Body Butter. A favorite of Dr. Jaliman\u2019s, the superfood-packed body lotion is just what you need to nourish and protect the skin. \u201cShea butter is extremely moisturizing and anti-inflammatory,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">Coconut oil is moisturizing</a> and is naturally antibacterial,\u201d she notes. \u201cSpirulina is also anti-microbial and contains amino acids and essential fatty acids,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Simpson, \u201cWith 70% protein, fatty acids and iron, spirulina offers a synergy of nutrients needed to promote hair growth.\u201d And one of the best ways to reap the benefits of spirulina\u2019s hair growth capabilities is by ingesting supplements formulated with the blue-green algae.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Super+Greens+Supplement+Powder_71286.htm?keyword=71286\">Perricone MD Super Greens Supplement Powder </a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Enriched with skin-benefiting ingredients\u2014such as Nrf2 Antioxidant Support Complex and B vitamins\u2014which work from the inside out\u2014this dietary supplement can help support the body\u2019s defense system in order to prevent premature signs of aging, naturally energize and improve mental focus and clarity.</p>"},

Not only can a label tell you what the product is (moisturizer, serum, eye cream) and who it\u2019s formulated for (anti-aging, dry skin, acne-prone), it can also give you more insight into how the formula came to be and if it is eco-friendly, organic, cruelty-free or vegan.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to knowing whether or not a product was made with high standards, taking a closer look at a product label can also help you make a confident decision and leave you feeling good about your selection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need help decoding the labels on your skin care and beauty products? Keep reading for a guide to some popular logos, words, phrases and ingredient information.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to natural beauty products, not all ingredients have to be natural. \u201cAs long as a few ingredients that are listed are natural, the product can be labeled as natural,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist,\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debra Jaliman</a>. \u201cIf a product is labeled as \u2018natural\u2019 it will generally mean that at least some natural ingredients have been used in the formula, but a product can be labeled as natural and contain up to 30% synthetic ingredients,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf you are looking for a product that is completely natural, make sure it\u2019s labeled 100% natural. [This] means there are absolutely no synthetic ingredients,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition, 100% natural products might also include a certified logo, such as one from the <a href=\"http://www.npainfo.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Natural Product Association (NPA)</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin, look for skin care and makeup products that are labeled hypoallergenic, as they are less likely to cause allergic reactions. That said, if your skin is prone to allergic reactions, you\u2019ll want to test the product out on the inside of your wrist or consult a dermatologist before applying a generous amount to your complexion, as the term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/product-labels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">hypoallergenic</a>\u201d is not regulated by the FDA and does not guarantee you won\u2019t experience an adverse reaction.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who have oily skin or are prone to breakouts, look for a product that is <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/acne-and-rosacea/skin-care-habits-that-worsen-acne\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">non-comedogenic</a>. \u201cAnyone who is acne-prone should use non-comedogenic products,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cIt means that the product does not contain ingredients that are known to clog up the pores, which increases the chances of getting acne,\u201d she adds. Non-comedogenic products come in a variety of formulas, including ones you wouldn\u2019t think possible, like facial oils and sunscreens.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you take a look at your perfume collection, you may notice the word \u201cparfum\u201d written on the label. Simply put, parfum is French for perfume or fragrance. Because the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Ingredients/ucm388821.htm#labeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FDA</a> does not require cosmetic companies to individually disclose each fragrance, parfum or fragrance can stand for a variety of fragrant ingredients, both synthetic and natural.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So, how do you tell if your parfum (or, skin care, hair care and makeup) is formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-fragrances/\">naturally derived fragrances</a>? Check the ingredients label for them. \u201cProducts that say they contain natural fragrances are constructed with natural, raw materials like isolates. Isolates are substances that have been naturally isolated from a botanical, also known as essential oils,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Jaliman, one of the biggest difference between synthetic and natural fragrances (aside from one being synthetic and one being natural) is that \u201csynthetic fragrances last longer than natural fragrances. Natural fragrances fade quickly because they lack the non-synthetic components, which makes a scent more vibrant and last longer,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who are sensitive to fragrance, products with a fragrance-free certification or Safer Choice logo are a must. \u201cAdded fragrances can cause allergies,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cChoose products that don\u2019t include fragrance as part of the [ingredient] list,\u201d she adds. According to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-10/documents/saferchoice-factsheet-fragrancefree_0.pdf\">EPA</a>, a fragrance-free product cannot include any fragrance, including the chemicals used to mask a scent.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because a product is unscented doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t contain fragrance. If that were true, it would just be called (and certified) fragrance-free. Unlike fragrance-free products, unscented formulas <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/product-labels\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">may contain chemicals used to mask scents</a>, making them scent-free, but not fragrance-free. Unscented products are ideal for those who are not sensitive to fragrance, but prefer a formula that doesn\u2019t have a scent.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another phrase to look out for? Sulfate-free. \u201cSulfates are aggressive detergents (commonly used in shampoos) made of sulfur-containing mineral salts,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them in products because they are harsh and can cause irritation on [the] scalp or other areas,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sulfates aren\u2019t the only ingredients to be wary of. Phthalates can be harmful, too. \u201cPhthalates are a group of chemicals used in hundreds of products, such as soaps, shampoos and lotions,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cThere are different types of phthalates, [but] the one still most commonly used in cosmetics is DEP,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey are used in personal care products to moisturize and soften skin and to aid in dissolving certain ingredients. [This] can damage the liver, kidneys and reproductive system,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you look on the back of your beauty product label, you may notice the words \u201cparaben-free.\u201d But, what are parabens and why do we want them out of our beauty products? \u201cParabens are used as preservatives in cosmetic products,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. They are used to prevent the growth of bacteria, [but] have been known as estrogen disruptors [and] have been linked to breast cancer and reproductive issues,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shopping for sunscreen? Make sure to select a sunscreen formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/sunscreen-glossary/\">broad-spectrum SPF</a>. \u201cA broad-spectrum sunscreen protects you from both UVA and UVB rays,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. UVA rays can prematurely age your skin, causing wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, [while] UVB rays can burn your skin,\u201d she adds. \u201cYou need broad-spectrum SPF because you want protection from all UV light\u2014too much exposure to [both] rays may lead to cancer,\u201d she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because a product has a certified cruelty-free logo printed on its label doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s vegan. For a vegan skin care or beauty product you can trust, Dr. Jaliman says to look for the <a href=\"https://vegan.org/certification-process/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vegan Action</a> or Vegan Awareness Foundation logo. Both of these logos certify that a product is formulated with vegan ingredients. In addition, Dr. Jaliman adds, \u201cFor a product to be considered vegan, it must not contain animal products or by-products [and] must not be tested on animals.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just like cruelty-free and vegan products, organic products also need to be legitimized by a special certification. For products formulated with organic ingredients, look for the certified organic or <a href=\"https://www.usda.gov/topics/organic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">USDA organic</a> symbol on the product label.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That said, don\u2019t be fooled by marketing. If you see the word \u201corganic\u201d and no certification on a label, it might not be organic. \u201cIn order for a product to be considered \u2018certified organic,\u2019 the item must be 95% or higher free of synthetic additives like pesticides, chemical fertilizers and dyes,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another certification logo to look out for? <a href=\"http://www.ecocert.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ecocert</a>. \u201cIf a product has an ecocert logo, it means it has been inspected by one of the highest respected organizations that determine if a product is organic,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cEcocert is an organic certification organization based in Europe, but conducts inspections in over 80 countries,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt is one of the largest organic certification organizations in the world,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The <a href=\"http://www.paosymbol.com/\">PAO symbol</a>\u2014or, period-after-opening symbol\u2014is another important logo to look out for. It looks like a small jar of body butter with a number and the letter \u201cM\u201d written inside or underneath it. The number represents a product\u2019s expiration date once opened for the first time. For example: If you open a product labeled \u201c12M,\u201d you have 12 months to use it before it\u2019s considered expired.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for a skin care or beauty product that is certified cruelty-free, check the label for a Leaping Bunny logo, issued by <a href=\"https://www.crueltyfreeinternational.org/what-you-can-do/go-cruelty-free-leaping-bunny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cruelty Free International</a>. According to board-certified dermatologist, <a href=\"http://drjaliman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Jaliman</a>, \u201cIf a product has a bunny on it, it means it has not been tested on animals.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your beauty product has a Leaping Bunny logo on it, it also means that it\u2019s globally recognized as cruelty-free and has gone through a variety of rigorous testing (which includes independent audits by Cruelty Free International). According to the organization, this is to ensure transparency between the brand and consumer, as brands often include cruelty-free jargon (and can go as far as to include a variation of a bunny logo) on the packaging without certification, causing confusion. To be sure your so-called \u201ccruelty-free\u201d product is legit, check the label for the specific Leaping Bunny logo associated with Cruelty Free International.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to important words and phrases used on beauty product labels, you may also want to take a look at the ingredients list. \u201cThis is essential, especially if you\u2019re someone with sensitive skin,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cSomeone who has sensitive skin can experience inflammation and irritation if they choose a cleanser, moisturizer or cosmetic product with ingredients that are harsh for their skin type,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s important to choose the right skin care for sensitive types because some products contain ingredients that can cause an adverse reaction.\u201d Furthermore, Dr. Jaliman says, \u201cPeople with rosacea, eczema or allergies should pay close attention to the ingredients in their products.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another reason to read the ingredients list? It can help you get a better sense of where the formula (and its ingredients) were before being bottled up and placed on the shelf. \u201cHaving too many ingredients listed may be a bad thing [because] the more ingredients a product has, the more likely the product or its ingredients have been tested on animals,\u201d she adds. If this is something you\u2019re concerned about, shop for products with the Leaping Bunny logo (mentioned above) and consider purchasing vegan beauty products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, the ingredients list can tell a formula\u2019s unique story and help you better determine if the product is right for you. \u201cYou can tell which ingredients have higher concentrations because ingredients are listed in order from greatest to least amount,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman. \u201cOne should pay attention to this because ingredients can be listed low on the list (meaning lowest concentration), [but] may be irritating even in very small amounts,\u201d she adds. If you have never heard of an ingredient before and are concerned about what it is and the effect that it might have on your skin, Dr. Jaliman suggests researching the specific ingredient online or consulting a dermatologist before slathering it all over your skin.</p>"},

While you snooze, your body recovers from all that you did during the day, and so does your skin. So, why not take your sleep to the next level by slathering your skin with an overnight treatment? \u201cOvernight treatments are skin products that will help to hydrate, firm and nourish your skin while you sleep,\u201d says </span><a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/steven-wang\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Steven Wang</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, M.D., board-certified dermatologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. \u201cThese products range from treating and preventing acne to promote a natural and radiant glow for your skin.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overnight treatments often contain more concentrated ingredients or are formulated to deliver the ingredients in a different way than typical night creams and serums, explains Sejal Shal, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and </span><a href=\"https://www.realself.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RealSelf</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> contributor. \u201cNighttime sleep is when the skin naturally repairs and renews itself. Many overnight treatments work with the body\u2019s natural circadian rhythm and target the skin when it\u2019s most receptive,\u201d says Shah.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To pick the right overnight treatment for you, \u201cUnderstand the issue or concerns you wish to address,\u201d says Wang. \u201cNext, pick the active ingredients that cater to your needs. Then, choose the vehicle, such as gel, serum or oil. Lastly, you must try the texture and aroma.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speaking of ingredients, Wang says that retinol is one of the most common ones found in overnight treatments (it\u2019s great for anti-aging), but it can be drying and cause redness and flakiness, so make sure you\u2019re keeping up with moisturizing during the day. Some of the other popular ingredients you\u2019ll see in overnight treatments are benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, sulfur, clays and tea-tree oil for acne; hyaluronic acid, fatty acids, ceramides, squalene, oils, butters and glycerin for dry skin; clays, charcoal and tea-tree oil for oily skin; antioxidants, vitamin C and hydroxy acids for dull skin; and peptides, hyaluronic acid, moisturizers and hydroxy acids for aging skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ready to add an overnight treatment to your beauty routine? Here are some of the most popular options sold on Dermstore.com. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes acne treatments are drying, but this one soothes as it fights pimples while you sleep. Salicylic acid exfoliates to clear skin, rosemary and spiraea extracts kill bacteria, tea-tree oil promotes healing and niacinamide calms redness. Just apply it over your zits after your nighttime cleanse. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have dry skin, it sometimes looks a little, shall we say,\u00a0lackluster. This overnight treatment boosts your glow and fades dark spots with vitamin C and retinol and exfoliates dull skin and targets wrinkles with glycolic and lactic acids. Plus, three probiotic strains hydrate your complexion and protect it against free radical damage. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dark spots are notoriously difficult to get rid of, but you can fade their appearance with the right overnight treatment. This one utilizes a natural alternative to hydroquinone and Gigawhite to lighten spots, punarnava root to even out skin tone, stone crop to moisturize and licorice root to provide anti-inflammatory effects. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Retinol is the gold standard for wrinkles, as it encourages cell turnover, and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll find in these nighttime resurfacing pads. In addition to retinol these pads feature vitamin C to brighten, aloe vera to soothe, antioxidants to protect and dimethicone to prevent moisture loss. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ease stress, on your skin that is, with this cooling overnight treatment that\u2019s made specifically for irritated skin (it\u2019s especially useful if you\u2019ve just had a procedure and are experiencing redness). Cucumber extract soothes, dipeptides curb heat sensitivity and hyaluronic acid comforts by boosting hydration. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your face isn\u2019t the only area where wrinkles can make their presence known. They can pop up on your chest, too. Enter this medical-grade silicone chest pad, which improves the look of chest wrinkles while you sleep. It can also be used to target stretch marks and scarring. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get your hair in on the fun with this overnight treatment that repairs hair while you catch those Zzz\u2019s. Proteins and amino acids penetrate hair to replenish it from the inside, lipids bring back shine and softness and moisturizing ingredients seal your hair\u2019s cuticle. </span></p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/skin-care-for-swimmers/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">5 Ways to Care for Your Skin Before and After a Swim</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jane Chertoff \u00b7 May 1, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spending a lazy summer day at a beautiful pool may be the best way to enjoy the season. And with warm weather just around the corner, you\u2019ve probably got your beach bag ready with a new swimsuit, towel and clarifying shampoo. Before you dive in, though, you might want to spend some time prepping your skin, too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While chlorine\u2019s harsh effects on the scalp (and that nasty knack for turning your hair green) get all the attention, it turns out that pool chemicals may be equally unkind to your skin if you\u2019re not careful. (If you\u2019ve ever felt itchy after swimming in a pool, you\u2019ve already experienced this \u201cscaly mermaid\u201d skin.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s how dermatologists recommend caring for your skin before and after a swim.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cChlorine is added to swimming pools to disinfect and prevent the rise and spread of bacterial, viral and protozoan diseases,\u201d explains Dr. Estee Williams, a <a href=\"https://dianemadfes.com/esther-williams-m-d/\">board-certified dermatologist</a> in New York City. \u201cDue to its caustic nature, chlorine is a cause of irritant contact dermatitis, namely red, dry, itchy skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To avoid that uncomfortable itch and redness, Williams recommends prepping your skin with a barrier cream before getting in the pool. Look for products with glycerin, oils or petrolatum listed on the ingredients. Bonus if it contains dimethicone, which forms a seal between the chlorine and your delicate skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Note: Not all pools allow moisturizers to be worn by swimmers, as they may interfere with the disinfecting chemicals. Check the rules before lathering up.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Lipikar+Balm+AP+Intense+Repair+Moisturizing+Cream_74002.htm\">La Roche-Posay\u00a0Lipikar Balm AP+ Intense Repair Moisturizing Cream</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You already know you usually need to rinse off before entering the pool, per the listed rules. But if you wait until you get home to shower after a swim, you\u2019re doing your skin a disservice. \u201cRinse off right after!\u201d cautions Dr. Kristina Goldenberg, <a href=\"http://goldenbergdermatology.com/about/\">board-certified dermatologist</a> in New York City. \u201cDo not let the chlorinated water sit on the skin for a long period of time,\u201d she warns. Warm-to-cool, clean water is best to avoid additional dryness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the locker room, you may also use a mild and hydrating cleanser or body wash to start to restore the skin\u2019s pH balance from the pool chemicals, per the American Academy of Dermatology. After rinsing off, reapply a moisturizer to restore hydration to the skin, Goldenberg recommends.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Brazilian+4+Play+Moisturizing+Shower+CreamGel_72048.htm\">Sol de Janeiro\u00a0Brazilian 4 Play Moisturizing Shower Cream-Gel</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After a cool dip, you may be tempted to just lie on your towel and let the sun dry you off. That\u2019s not the best idea, Goldenberg cautions. \u201cThere is a misconception that air-drying is beneficial for the skin, but that\u2019s simply not the case. Air-drying will lead to more dryness of the skin,\u201d she says. She recommends rinsing off with clean water (see above) and then drying yourself with a cotton towel instead. After that, it\u2019s time to get back to sunning\u2014after applying more SPF, of course.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Try: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_SPF+30+Body+Classic+Sunscreen+_19032.htm\">Coola SPF 30 Body Classic Sunscreen</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your skin is still feeling dry/flaky after you get home from the pool, switch to a thicker moisturizer or ointment. \u201cRemember, lotions are not as hydrating as creams, and creams are not as hydrating as ointments,\u201d Goldenberg says. \u201cWhat works for one person may not work for you.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Williams echoes the suggestion for an ointment after a long day in the sun and pool. \u201cApply a thick emollient (ointment) to the skin from the neck down before going to bed,\u201d she suggests.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_First+Aid+Ointment_46596.htm\">Emuaid First Aid Ointment</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Luckily, swimming doesn\u2019t usually lead to breakouts on your face. However, it may be as dry and irritating for the face as for the rest of your body, notes Goldenberg. \u201cHydration before and after swimming is key,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd remember to rinse your face right after the pool, too!\u201d</p>"},

These actions, along with very mild microcurrent that is generated by drawing light into a solar panel fixed in the handle, stimulate your skin and facial muscles, boosting circulation, enhancing firmness and improving skin tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Slightly smaller than the original <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_ReFa+CARAT_49451.htm\">ReFa Carat</a> (also a Dermstore favorite!), ReFa S is not only more portable but also fashioned to fit the subtle undulations of your facial contours: around the eyes, nose and lips. Th\u00ad\u00ade surface of this roller is coated in brilliant platinum, which, according to the brand, makes it compatible with even the most delicate skin. And because it\u2019s solar-powered, it never requires plugging in or battery replacement.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00ad</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But don\u2019t just take our word for it. Here are the many reasons Dermstore shoppers love ReFa S Carat.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gravity may not be our skin\u2019s friend, but just like a good workout, using this roller can help improve the appearance of sagging, jiggly skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAfter using ReFa for five days, I started to notice a difference, specifically my skin felt firmer, my brow was feeling lifted and my neck wasn\u2019t quite so jiggly. I was pleasantly surprised. After two weeks, I took an \u2018after\u2019 picture and I could really see a positive effect on my brow, face (clown lines) and neck,\u201d says one Dermstore reviewer.\u00a0\u201cYou definitely need to use it consistently (daily) for about five minutes on your face/neck to get the benefit. I can feel a difference if I go more than 24 to 48 hours without using it. I\u2019m still amazed that this little thing works.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just imagine how a massage feels after an intense workout. Now imagine that same massage on your face after a day of smiling, smooching, frowning, raising your eyebrows and drinking from a straw. That is what ReFa S Carat is all about.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI\u2019ve been using this face device for several months and I am loving it,\u201d says one Dermstore shopper. \u201cIt provides a very pleasant massage that is both revitalizing and relaxing. It is toning the skin, as well as activating the blood and lymph circulations, which provides health benefits.\u00a0It is also great to not need to use any toxic lotion\u00a0and to not have to deal with a power cord. I really enjoy my ReFa treatment [and use it] every other day!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from the gentle massaging action, shoppers also appreciate the rosy glow it leaves from boosting your skin\u2019s circulation. One shopper explains: \u201cI really enjoy the cooling, massaging motion. It makes my skin nice and flushed due to the increased circulation. I\u2019ll keep it up as it\u2019s a nice part of my morning and/or nightly ritual.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One Dermstore shopper appreciates this benefit: \u201cI have recently been placed on a medication which caused me to retain an excessive amount of water in my face. I took a chance on this device to use for lymphatic drainage and was AMAZED at how quickly this roller remedied my issue. I use twice daily.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another benefit you get from helping your lymphatic system? Getting rid of puffiness. \u201cI really love using this,\u201d says another Dermstore shopper. \u201cOn mornings where I feel my face is a little puffy, I just use this to lift and tighten my skin/jawline. It has a temporary effect. In the evenings, it works as a great tool for a nice facial massage (and is a great way to massage all the skin care products into your face). It looks so luxurious as well. I love using it and will continue to use it. This one is particularly good for the jawline, smile line, eyes and forehead!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ReFa S Carat\u2019s shape makes it great to use around the eyes, a royal treat for those who struggle with under-eye puffiness. \u201cI enjoy using this in the mornings and evenings as a new addition to my skin care routine,\u201d says one Dermstore reviewer. \u201cThe roller is a lovely massage and I do notice a decrease in eye bags after using it. A bit pricey, but would still recommend if it\u2019s within your budget.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With all these benefits, most users of the device say it\u2019s worth the investment. And because it requires zero maintenance or any part replacement, this device could last for a long time. \u201cWhile there are scads of beauty tools for the face, I have not been able to find one that is small enough to fit smaller contours around the eyes, nose and mouth, so I think this lives up to its billing in that regard,\u201d says one Dermstore shopper. \u201cIts effects are subtle but real in smoothing out the complexion, reducing morning puffiness and making the skin look more supple. The tingling sensation is so faint so as not to cause any discomfort, but leaves the skin feeling warm. Well-designed without the use of those pesky battery charges. Just wipe whether used on clean skin or with serums. Better investment than yet another jar of expensive \u2018miracle cream\u2019!\u201d</p>"},

Yet the same fairy dust (ahem\u2014hormones) that flushes our cheeks with a \u201cpregnancy glow\u201d happens to also bring unwanted skin changes. So on top of the million-and-one concerns running through your mommy-to-be brain, you\u2019re now thinking about skin care ingredients and beauty treatments to avoid while pregnant, nursing or trying to conceive (TTC).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What worked for your skin once upon a time may no longer be what your skin needs during this new chapter of your life. \u201cOur skin becomes very sensitive and often changes texture, character and even tone,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.shilpimd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Shilpi Agarwal</a>, board-certified Family Medicine Physician and Medical Advisor to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Belli+Beauty_500225.htm\">Belli Beauty</a>. Agarwal notes that the use of harsh chemicals or even your normal skin care routine can dull your complexion and cause rashes. With this in mind, it\u2019s time to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/skin-care-while-pregnant/\">adopt a new regimen</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The problem is that your skin is the frontline defense against daily toxicities but that some products are designed to penetrate the skin, potentially entering the bloodstream and harming your little one. \u201cThey can affect our hormonal cycles and interfere with organ development in an unborn baby,\u201d adds Agarwal.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This goes for every new-mom stage. \u201cNursing moms\u2019 skin comes in direct contact with [the] baby and small amounts of toxins from body lotions on the breast can be absorbed into young babies skin and have damaging effects,\u201d which Agarwal says usually appears in the form of skin rashes on the baby.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you try your best to care for your little tyke, you may find that even the <a href=\"https://aestheticsjournal.com/feature/using-skincare-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">smallest risk of toxicity</a> from your go-to skin care\u00a0products is out of the question. So to help you and your baby stay safe during this exciting time, we brought you a breakdown of the top ingredients and treatments to avoid while pregnant, breastfeeding or TTC.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These acne-fighting ingredients have become the gold standard in clearing pores and exfoliating dead skin cells but are generally not recommended for hypersensitive skin. This comes as ultra-bad news for new moms for whom practically all will experience extra sensitivity to just about everything, including <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/salicylic-acid-benzoyl-peroxide/\">salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSalicylic acid is the most common beta hydroxy acid (BHA) you\u2019ll find listed as an ingredient and the only BHA that has been studied in pregnancy,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.bluskincare.info/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zondra Wilson</a>, Founder and CEO of Blu Skin Care. \u201cHigh doses of the acid in its oral form (it\u2019s an ingredient in aspirin) have been shown in studies to cause birth defects and various pregnancy complications,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Doctor\u2019s recommendation:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AntiBlemish+Facial+Wash_10327.htm\">Belli Beauty Anti-Blemish Face Wash</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Utilizing salicylic acid\u2019s more gentle cousin, lactic acid, this face wash \u201cstill helps cleanse and remove dead skin without the same irritating aftereffects,\u201d Agarwal notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A miracle acne-treatment for some women, retinoic acid is available only from a doctor\u2019s authorization. That is, until you\u2019re trying to conceive, at which you should cease use and store away. Retinoids, among <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-are-retinoids/\">other forms</a>, can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3114665/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cause birth defects</a> such as malformation, and jump to the top of the list of what to avoid when trying to get pregnant.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A therapeutic, highly concentrated substance extracted from plants, essential oils are <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/aromatherapy-fragrance/\">generally good for your skin</a>, and there are a handful of essential oils you can continue to use while pregnant as long as you are careful. But\u2014and this is a big but\u2014some of these powerful perfumes can cause contractions, explains <a href=\"http://alexandraleny.com/health-coaching/Home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alexandra Gouteron Le Ny</a>, Certified Health Coach, Yoga Instructor and Reiki Healer, as she calls out oils on an\u00a0<em>avoid </em>list including cumin, fennel, oregano, rosemary and thyme.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Indulge in these instead:</strong> Eucalyptus, black pepper, frankincense, geranium, peppermint or ylang-ylang, diluted with a carrier oil such as coconut, grapeseed or sweet almond oil.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t worry, you can still sunbathe! Sunscreens are generally A-OK but to be extra safe, choose an <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-sunscreen-alternatives/\">all-natural option</a> that doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin. Agarwal taps into her expert advice to recommend a mineral-based sunscreen because it provides a physical barrier using zinc, a safer alternative ingredient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s no evidence of hair dye harming the baby; however many mothers-to-be choose to wait until the second trimester (when the baby is more developed) to tint their tresses in order to minimize any possible damage to their growing baby. Did we mention those fumes? Hair dying doesn\u2019t smell so sweet (actually, it\u2019s toxic) so it\u2019s very important to be in <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/949.aspx?CategoryID=54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a well-ventilated room</a> if doing so.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Opt for a trendy balayage look by only highlighting from midshaft down, leaving the roots untouched so that the chemicals are only absorbed by your strands and not by your scalp.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Getting your fake tan on is deemed okay when pregnant. That\u2019s because the active ingredient, dihydroxyacetone, is non-toxic and can\u2019t move beyond the skin barrier. But what to avoid while breastfeeding? <a href=\"https://www.babycentre.co.uk/x562989/is-it-safe-to-use-fake-tans-during-pregnancy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Refrain from using self-tanner</a> around the breast area where your baby comes into contact with your skin. While these ingredients are not toxic to our skin, if applied to the breast the baby is exposed orally to the product and <a href=\"https://www.lllc.ca/todays-tip-tanning-and-breastfeeding\">studies have suggested</a>\u00a0this can harm baby\u2019s cell and organ development.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the reverse end, tanning by sunbeds during pregnancy is a big no-no. Sunbeds may cause your body to overheat and the harmful UV rays are also <a href=\"http://www.health-and-parenting.com/beauty-treatments-safe-pregnancy\">found to break down folic acid</a> which is extremely important for healthy development.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, more stress from these new-mom worries can sometimes equal more wrinkles. And while Botox is generally thought to stay in the area it is injected (ingredients not reaching the developing baby), there isn\u2019t enough data to back this up, so most healthcare providers advise postponing this treatment until after you give birth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Much like with hair dyes, you don\u2019t have to say goodbye to mani-pedis for a full nine months. \u201cHowever, you may have to skip this part for two reasons,\u201d says Zondra Wilson. \u201cFirst, the smell may irritate you, especially if your pregnancy is sensitive. Second, if you remove calluses before painting your nails, you\u2019ll have a higher chance of cutting yourself,\u201d she notes. Pregnant women are at <a href=\"https://www.babycenter.com/404_is-it-safe-to-get-a-manicure-or-pedicure-while-im-pregnant_1246884.bc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">higher risk of infection</a> so experts recommend simply trimming your nails for a while.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you are allowed to indulge in an extra serving (or two!) of those Italian herb breadsticks, this is not the time to throw caution to the wind when it comes to your skin care routine. So what\u2019s your next move? Caring for your changing skin and your little one\u2019s 100% well-being, of course! Remember, the importance of updating your skin care routine is twofold: your changing estrogen levels shifting and the potential harm of certain ingredients found in skin care products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to make the switch? Start by switching to mostly unscented skin care products, using all-natural remedies when possible or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-brands-for-babies/\">purchasing from brands designed with moms</a> in mind. \u201cIf you\u2019re dealing with <a href=\"https://www.babycenter.com/0_acne-during-pregnancy_1456557.bc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pregnancy-induced acne</a>, a dermatologist can likely give you a safe topical antibiotic,\u201d notes Wilson. Talking to your doctor is always the best remedy and be sure to mention to your manicurist or hairstylist if you are pregnant.</p>"},

Think again! Moisturizing is one of the most important steps in any and all skin care routines\u2014<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-moisturizers-dry-oily-sensitive-skin/\">no matter what your type may be</a>. In fact, according to board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.drjaliman.com/debra-jaliman-md.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Rules-Trade-Secrets-Dermatologist/dp/1250025109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologist</em>,</a>\u00a0everyone needs <em>some </em>kind of moisturizer, but different amounts, depending on the skin type. \u201cAlthough oily skin needs the least amount of moisture, applying a moisturizer remains a vital step in nourishing and hydrating the skin.\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Moisturize-Oily-Skin-in-5-Steps_2010.htm\">choosing a moisturizer for oily skin</a>, Dr. Jaliman suggests picking \u201ca lighter product as opposed to a heavy one\u2014such as\u00a0a hydrating serum or lotion versus a heavy cream\u2014as it is more compatible for oily skin.\u201d In addition, you\u2019ll want to ensure that the moisturizer is made with your skin type in mind and enriched with lightweight yet effective ingredients that can replenish moisture in the skin without causing it to react and produce excess sebum. One of Dr. Jaliman\u2019s favorite moisturizing ingredients? Hyaluronic acid. Known as the body\u2019s natural hydrator, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid is super lightweight</a> and can attract moisture to the skin without clogging pores, resulting in softer, smoother, more supple-looking skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With that being said, make room for some of our favorite hyaluronic acid\u2013infused oily skin moisturizers, plus other stellar lightweight daily moisturizers, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some of the best lightweight moisturizers for oily skin are those with mattifying technologies that nourish the complexion without the unwanted glow of grease. Specifically formulated with oily complexions types in mind, La Roche-Posay\u2019s Effaclar Mat Daily Moisturizer for Oily Skin is enriched with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">skin-protecting vitamin C</a> and E, as well as salicylic acid zinc oxide.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$31.99</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from shiny skin, those prone to excess oil may also experience more regular breakouts and blemishes. And unfortunately, if using the wrong moisturizer\u2014aka one that isn\u2019t breathable and doesn\u2019t promote clear skin\u2014it could make things a lot worse. Luckily, products like PCA Skin\u2019s Clearskin is here for you! Enriched with niacinamide, this lightweight moisturizer can help the skin retain moisture levels, which can ultimately help keep excess oil at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$42</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When shopping for an oily skin-friendly moisturizer, be on the lookout for words like \u201cwater\u201d and \u201cgel.\u201d Both are indications of lightweight, breathable formulas that will replenish the skin\u2019s moisture levels without overdoing it. In addition to its lightweight formula, we love Dermalogica\u2019s Calm Water Gel for its ability to soothe and protect the skin with ingredients such as, cactus pear extract and vitamin C.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$48</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whipped formulas make great lightweight moisturizers for oily skin and \u00c9minence Organic Skin Care\u2019s Rosehip Whip Moisturizer sets the bar high with its breathable, oil-balancing ability. Enriched with rosehip extract, this daily moisturizer nourishes skin and replenishes moisture without leaving any excess grease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong><strong>Price: </strong>$58</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When browsing for a lightweight moisturizer, look for formulas that are non-oily or oil-free. These types of hydrators ensure a nourished complexion without the oil slick and can leave the skin feeling ultra-soft post-application. Case in point: SkinMedica\u2019s Ultra Sheer Moisturizer. Enriched with antioxidant-rich vitamins C and E, as well as dimethicone, this daily moisturizer works to create a sheer shield of hydration, smooth the look of skin and leave the complexion with a bout of comfort all day long.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$58</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hyaluronic acid is an important ingredient in any moisturizer, especially a lightweight, oily skin-friendly formula. That said, one formulated with hyaluronic acid and glycolic acid\u2014such as Dr. Dennis Gross Skincare\u2019s Hyaluronic Marine Moisture Cushion\u2014can truly make a difference to your complexion. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">Glycolic acid is a chemical exfoliant</a> that works to slough off blemish-causing dead skin cells and make it easier for nourishing ingredients (such as, hyaluronic acid) to absorb into the skin and work its magic.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$60</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to oily, blemish-prone skin, exfoliation is key. And, using products formulated with powerful ingredients that lift away dead skin cells and moisturize at the same time can make the difference between happy, healthy skin and an oil-ridden complexion. We love Sunday Riley\u2019s Tidal Brightening Enzyme Water Cream for its fabulous oil-friendly ingredients\u2014such as, papaya enzymes and tamarind extract\u2014that work to slough off dead skin cells and give the skin a burst of non-greasy moisture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$65</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t think that because you have oily skin you can\u2019t use an oil for nourishment. As it turns out, there are a few oils\u2014such as, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-natural-face-oils/\">jojoba oil</a> and grapeseed oil\u2014that are lightweight enough to not clog pores. With that said, consider Lancer Skincare\u2019s Omega Hydrating Oil as a lightweight moisturizer. Enriched with grapeseed oil and a chlorophyllin-copper complex that can refine the look of pores, this fast-absorbing oil can leave the complexion feeling super soft and smooth with a healthy, non-greasy glow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$75</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the words \u201cexfoliating\u201d and \u201chydrating\u201d in its name, Obagi\u2019s IDR Exfoliating and Hydrating Lotion is a must-try. Lightweight and nourishing, this daily moisturizer consists of skin-calming ingredients (we see you, Matricaria flower extract), as well as sodium hyaluronate to help moisture levels stay where they need to be to ensure oil production doesn\u2019t kick into high gear and create excess sebum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$75</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking for an anti-aging moisturizer that doubles as a lightweight, oily skin-friendly hydrator? Look no further. Angela Caglia Skincare\u2019s Souffle Moisturizer is jam-packed with anti-aging ingredients\u2014such as, meadowfoam seed oil, chlorophyll, hyaluronic acid and rose geranium\u2014that work in tandem to target signs of aging and replenish the skin with a lightweight but effective layer of hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$110</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite having skin that is on the oily side of the spectrum, it can still be possible for your complexion to experience a bout of dehydration. If that\u2019s the case, reach for 111SKIN\u2019s Cryo Activating Hydra Gel. Enriched with some of the best ingredients for oily skin\u2014such as, lotus extract, which can give oily skin a boost of hydration without that weighted feel\u2014this lightweight moisturizer can replenish the complexion, protect against free radical damage and help fight signs of aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: </strong>$200</p>"},

It\u2019s one of the skin care products even the most basic regimen should have\u2014and for good reason: Not only does it protect against UVB, or the ray that causes sunburn and skin cancer, it also protects against UVA, which accelerates skin aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite it being basic, sunscreen is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing. Different skin types, concerns and preferences have spawned different kinds of sunscreen formulas\u2014from spray to powder to cream. But if there\u2019s one sunscreen product that consistently get high marks from Dermstore shoppers, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Clear+BroadSpectrum+SPF+46_20567.htm\">EltaMD\u00ae UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</a>. Keep scrolling to see why shoppers love this product.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We didn\u2019t sell over 20,000 bottles of this sunscreen for nothing. This oil-free, lightweight formula features 9% transparent micronized zinc oxide, which protects against damaging UVA and UVB rays. But aside from offering superb sun protection, most of our shoppers love how this unassuming bottle of protection also helps calm and protect sensitive skin types prone to breakouts, rosacea and discoloration. How? It contains some of the same ingredients found in your anti-aging creams and serums that help reduce the appearance of blemishes, discoloration and photo damage.\u00a0Here\u2019s a quick breakdown of what these ingredients are:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still not convinced? Our shoppers offered 1,000 reasons why they gave EltaMD\u00ae UV Clear 5 stars; here are just nine of them.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because you won\u2019t see this brand often in drugstores, most shoppers found out about this sunscreen through their dermatologists and estheticians, most of the time as part of their treatment plan.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One shopper wrote: \u201cMy dermatologist recommended this brand to me a while ago. The only non-greasy sunscreen that won\u2019t make my face look like an oil field or a ghost. I usually put this [on] after my Cerave moisturizer. A pea size for my face and neck and another pea size for chest area.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy esthetician recommended this sunscreen for my skin and I\u2019m so glad she did,\u201d wrote another Dermstore shopper. \u201cI have oily, acne-prone skin and don\u2019t like using many products on my face. I\u2019m able to use Elta MD as a primer for my makeup and I love the way it feels. Best sunscreen I\u2019ve used.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While most people complain that most sunscreens break them out, Elta MD UV Clear does the opposite, thanks to its acne-fighting ingredients niacinamide and lactic acid.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Dermstore shopper shared with us her struggle: \u201cAs a life-long acne sufferer who is now in her late thirties, and therefore concerned with minimizing the effects of aging as well, I was looking for the best possible protection I could get that would suit all of my needs. Chemical sunscreens often irritated my skin and the formulas could be difficult to layer on top of other products. Many wouldn\u2019t absorb, and instead would clump and/or flake off. Zinc sunscreens tended to be a bit too heavy for my oily skin, particularly during the warmer months.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI am so thrilled to have found a product that offers the benefit of zinc in a formula that is perfect for oily, acne-prone skin,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt absorbs wonderfully, feels great on the skin and provides excellent sun protection. The fact that this product also contains niacinamide and lactic acid, two highly regarded anti-aging and anti-acne ingredients, is a fabulous bonus! This product also has my dermatologist\u2019s absolute seal of approval. I am currently using my second bottle and would highly recommend it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are one of the 14 million Americans who struggles with rosacea, you probably have a hard time finding products that won\u2019t inflame your skin. The good news? This sunscreen is designed with you in mind.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s proof according to this one Dermstore shopper: \u201cThis sunscreen was recommended by my dermatologist to both provide good protection and help prevent rosacea flares. Most sunscreens which contain oxybenzone and/or avobenzone cause my skin to react (and so does octylsalicylate which is in EltaMD UV Sport). This formula, however, really does not seem to irritate my skin. The 5% niacinamide does appear effective in calming my skin. It protects well\u2014as long as you don\u2019t sweat it all off. It is moisturizing as well. It\u2019s enough to moisturize my combination skin even in the dry winter months due to the sodium hyaluronate and the smoothing silicones this formulation contains.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t have rosacea but your skin still reacts to aggressive formulas and certain ingredients? Then you may have sensitized skin. Sensitized skin is triggered by both external and internal factors like pollution, alcohol, chronic emotional and physical stress, poor diet\u00a0and your skin care products. If you find yourself torn between sunburn or skin irritation, this sunscreen might work for you.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s what one reviewer wrote: \u201cMy sister introduced me to this sunscreen last summer, finally ending my years-long search for a sunscreen that I could actually stand to put on my face. I have sensitive skin and every single brand I tried, even those advertised to be non-comedogenic or non-irritating, either clogged my pores or gave my poor face a rash\u2014sometimes both! So despite my fair skin and the history of skin cancer in my family, I refused to wear anything: and my face shows it. But last year I had a basal cell carcinoma removed from my arm; I don\u2019t want that happening on my face. Thankfully, I found this.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIt does not make my face break out nor does it sting or burn or cause any kind of skin reaction at all,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt absorbs quickly, is invisible on my face and doesn\u2019t feel sticky or greasy or tacky. I swear it helps make my face feel smoother and in combination with Paula\u2019s Choice 8% AHA lotion is gradually fading some of the hyperpigmentation on my face. Of course I wish it cost less, but I love this sunscreen and won\u2019t wear anything else.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While not in any way a treatment for dark spots and hyperpigmentation, this sunscreen has a unique formula that helps fade dark spots and even skin tone. This Dermstore reviewer couldn\u2019t have explained it better:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSince I\u2019m trying to combat post-acne hyperpigmentation, this sunscreen is ideal. Not only does it protect from UV damage, which exacerbates dark spots, it is formulated with niacinamide, which works as a lightening agent. My skin is incredibly temperamental, but I\u2019ve been using this for about 2 months consistently and I\u2019ve haven\u2019t had any issues! I even get compliments on my skin when I\u2019m wearing it alone; I think it has a mild blurring effect. It goes well under makeup, providing you give it enough time to sink in, preferably after your moisturizer has had a similar chance.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most shoppers liked how this sunscreen absorbs well and leaves a nice, matte finish. \u201cThis product is light, totally transparent and looks great alone or under makeup,\u201d wrote one shopper. \u201cMy skin feels softer and looks better when I use it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another one added: \u201cI am in the sun regularly and am always looking for ways to protect my skin that do not clog my pores or look greasy. This absorbs clear into the skin and doesn\u2019t leave a residue or heavy finish. I can apply makeup over it and there\u2019s no issues at all. No shine or cake-y look.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not a fan of that ghastly white cast most mineral sunscreens leave on your skin? Nor are we. Luckily this sunscreen won\u2019t give you that ghastly complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One shopper wrote: \u201cIt\u2019s so silky-smooth, it just glides evenly over your skin, which means you don\u2019t have to stand in front of the mirror blending for five full minutes to get your face to look normal. It does leave the slightest white cast, but it\u2019s actually very flattering and brightening, not ghastly or unnatural-looking at all.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Men can be stubborn when it comes to sunscreen application (and re-application), but this might be something they\u2019d consider.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One shopper explained: \u201cThis suncreen is great for my skin and my boyfriend\u2019s skin! It is very versatile and hydrating, but [without that] heavy feeling, even in hot weather! It sinks into the skin quickly and never leaves any residue. I will keep using this for years!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overall, shoppers love the versatility of this sunscreen, from the non-negotiable sun protection it provides to the nice-to-have benefits. Here\u2019s how one shopper put it:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have been searching for a mineral-based sunscreen that is effective (most important), emollient, but not greasy, able to wear alone or under makeup and does not leave a white mask. A lot of expectations, I know, but this product delivers on all of them. I\u2019m very particular with my skin care and don\u2019t care for products that are tacky, sticky or flaky\u2014all of which I did not experience with this sunscreen. Its application is easy and clean, but not completely matte. I love everything about this sunscreen.\u201d</p>"},

In my family, this is\u00a0only partially true: While my mom is the avid beauty fanatic, my dad has the most organized and detailed bathroom routine in the family. He was the one who\u00a0introduced me and my brothers to skin care.\u00a0Here are some things my dad taught me about <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/5-brilliant-gifts-every-man-in-your-life-will-keep/\">men\u2019s skin care</a> and other personal care practices.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the world of shaving, there is a big debate over whether you should cleanse before or after shaving. I\u2019ve discovered that it comes down to personal preference. In my experience, cleansing after shaving helps me minimize my pores and condition my skin after passing a sharp object over it. Whether you cleanse before or after shaving, always make sure your shaving utensils are clean and follow your shave with the right after-shave or moisturizer for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I\u2019ve often shared this tip with my friends and have definitely gotten looks of disbelief. But think about it: it has been proven that one of the reasons for hair loss is a lack of blood flow, mainly because we spent most of our time on our feet. By bending your head down and massaging your scalp, you are shifting the blood flow and stimulating your scalp. When paired with a protein or hair-stimulating shampoo, you\u2019ll have a better\u00a0chance of\u00a0promoting healthy hair growth.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Turbo+Wash+Energizing+Cleanser+for+Hair+Body_29935.htm\">Jack Black Turbo Wash Energizing Cleanser for Hair and Body</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever wondered why sometimes your cologne oddly changes its scent in the middle of the year? Just as our skin changes with the weather, the pH in it changes as well, causing your cologne to shift scent notes and smell different. Guys will often use the same cologne all year, but not my dad, he has a different cologne for every season of the year, and usually he would wear fresher scents for the spring and summer and change to muskier or sweeter scents in the fall and winter.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Eight++Bob++The+Original_71616.htm\">Eight &amp; Bob \u2013 The Original</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mani-pedis are not just a woman\u2019s thing, especially if you work with your hands or are on your feet all day. My dad would get one at least once a month and I remember him looking so happy and relaxed after. I dare you to get one and see if you don\u2019t come back every week. Now, if you prefer to take care of your own feet and hands, start by washing and exfoliating your feet and hands often and don\u2019t forget to use a hand cream or oil after. Trust me, you\u2019ll never be the same after using one.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Industrial+Strength+Hand+Healer_4110.htm\">Jack Black Industrial Strength Hand Healer</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is often that our eyes get neglected first. We don\u2019t think about the skin around them as being different than the rest of our face, but the truth is that the skin around our\u00a0eyes is\u00a0thinner and therefore the first area to show\u00a0signs of age. It was my dad who\u00a0first taught me about using an eye cream and how to apply it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing your first eye cream, don\u2019t be afraid to spend a little bit more. Eye creams tend to last longer since they cover a smaller portion of your face.

He\u2019s particular about everything, from having the right kind of toothbrush to the flavor of his toothpaste to\u00a0the thickness of his floss. Even his method is precise: 1) mouthwash (30 seconds); 2) floss (once a day); 3) brush (2 minutes, 30 seconds on each quadrant of the\u00a0mouth); 4) rinse (once). No matter how busy life gets, he\u2019ll go through this process three times a day (except for flossing, which he only does once a day).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You might be as religious as my dad with your oral care (or a little more flexible, like most of us), but whatever you do, pay close attention to your toothbrush and your toothpaste.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/wedding-skin-prep/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">Wedding Countdown: How to Prep Your Skin for the Big Day</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Dr. Heather D. Rogers \u00b7 June 4, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s wedding season once again! If you\u2019re a bride-to-be, you\u2019re probably already poring over bridal magazines to find the perfect hair-and-makeup inspirations for you\u2014but don\u2019t forget to prep your skin, too! Here are some tips to make sure your skin looks its best on your special day.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>See a dermatologist.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Go see a dermatologist and make a plan to address specific skin concerns in anticipation of the big day. It can take 6 months or longer to control acne and pigmentation so give yourself and your doctor enough time to get you the results you deserve.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another thing to ask your dermatologist is to create a tailored regimen for your skin. This should include a face wash, an antioxidant serum with vitamin C, a moisturizer, a zinc-based sunscreen and a vitamin A or alpha hydroxy acid (AHA)-based cream for your skin. If you suffer from dark circles, crepey skin or puffiness around your eyes, an eye cream to combat your concerns will also be helpful. Remember: it takes 90 to 120 days for you to see the results from an updated skin care regimen, so you have to start early and stick with it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are considering any injectable treatments like Botox or fillers, now is the time to learn more and see if they are right for you. I recommend going to a physician (MD) trained in cosmetics, like a dermatologist or plastic surgeon. Talk to them about your goals and concerns with the treatments. If you decide to have something done, also ask for a two-week follow-up so you can review your results with your physician.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Botox typically lasts 3 months while fillers can last 6 months to over a year. It will be far less stressful for you to experiment long before your wedding. And, if you love the results, you can schedule your next treatment within an appropriate time frame before the event.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now is the time to start skin treatments, such as peels or laser, that promote cell turnover to get that healthy skin glow. Skin products such as <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">antioxidant serums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">retinols</a> will improve your results and speed the recovery for these treatments. Options can be a superficial peel or laser, like Clear and Brilliant laser, intense pulsed light (IPL) or fractional resurfacing. The more gentle the treatment, the more treatments you may need to get outstanding results (for example: 6 peels vs 3 Clear + Brilliant or IPL treatments). Get your last treatment 1 month prior to your wedding.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you decided you liked your injectable treatment, now is the time to do the final touch-up before the wedding. This way, if anything is not perfect, there is still time to correct it before the big day.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Exfoliate and moisturize your body.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Use a chemical exfoliation product, whether in a wash or lotion, that has <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">AHA or beta hydroxy acid (BHA)</a> to break down dead cells on the top layer of the skin, thereby allowing further penetration of the moisturizer. Do not exfoliate with physical scrubs, loofah or brushes because those often remove living cells as well, causing damage and dehydration to the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong> Do not tan! </strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tanning is terrible for so many reasons. It is simply radiating your skin, causing mutations that lead to skin cancer, wrinkles and age spots. As a dermatologist, I want people to embrace the color of their skin. If you must do something, find a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/self-tanners-that-work/\">self-tanner that works</a> for you and practice with it until you get the glow you want. Also, self-tanner on the face rarely looks good and is hard to remove, so if you really need that sun-kissed glow, go get yourself a bronzer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stick to the skin care routine that has worked well for the past year. Now is not the time to experiment. It is a time to celebrate! Keep in mind that alcohol and salt can make you puffy, especially around the eyes, so consider saying \u201cno, thank you\u201d to that fourth dirty martini. Exercise to help deal with last-minute stressors and ensure better sleep. Then go have the time of your life!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Until next time,</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Heather D. Rogers, MD</p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/antioxidants-in-skin-care/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">Antioxidants in Skin Care: How Do They Work and Which Ones Are the Best?</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Dermstore Editors \u00b7 June 5, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If there is a magic potion that can delay skin aging and protect it from further damage, would you take it? For years, health and skin care companies have been searching for the \u201cfountain of youth\u201d and it looks like we have come close to a solution, all thanks to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583891/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">antioxidants</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to board-certified dermatologist Rhonda Klein of <a href=\"https://www.ctdermgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Connecticut Dermatology Group</a>, \u201cAntioxidants protect the skin by limiting free radical production, which can damage the skin. With daily use, they can reduce lentigines (sun spots), help combat visible signs of aging and calm skin inflammations. Several antioxidants provide the skin with hydration and increase moisture retention to help revitalize dull-looking skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Free radicals play a dual role in our body that can be both beneficial and harmful. Our body purposely creates free radicals to neutralize viruses and bacteria. However, too much of it affects the DNA, lipids and proteins that can trigger diseases. These free radicals are unstable, highly reactive molecules that have one or more unpaired electrons. To gain stability, they attack stable molecules, triggering a chain reaction that damages healthy cells. Once an overload of free radicals is present in our system, it causes oxidative stress, or an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the ability of the body to counteract or detoxify their harmful effects.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Environmental factors like radiation from the sun, pollution, radiation, cigarette smoke and other toxic chemicals are also known to trigger the formation of free radicals. Fortunately, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3614697/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">studies</a> have shown that the inclusion of antioxidants in your skin care regimen can help your skin fight free radical damage and recover from oxidative stress.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oxidative stress breaks down collagen, hinders skin\u2019s natural repair process and triggers inflammation\u2014and you see these as fine lines, wrinkles, loose skin, acne breakouts and a blotchy skin tone. By scavenging free radicals, antioxidants can help prevent and correct these visible signs and give skin a more youthful glow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cBy definition, all antioxidants have anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/18187-2/\">Ashley Magovern</a>, medical director at Dermstore. \u201cThey blunt your skin\u2019s inflammatory response to the sun\u2019s harmful rays, preventing sunburn and providing enhanced protection against sun damage and photoaging.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Inflamed skin impedes the skin\u2019s rejuvenation process. By reducing inflammation, antioxidants allow skin to repair itself and correct visible damage. \u201cSome antioxidants, like vitamin C, can also stimulate collagen production, which is vital for youthful skin,\u201d adds Dr. Magovern.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Free radicals and frequent sun exposure can also trigger changes in our skin\u2019s melanin production, causing dark spots and uneven skin tone. By reducing photodamage, antioxidants can help prevent abnormal skin pigmentations. Some antioxidants (again, like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">vitamin C)</a> also work as a tyrosinase (an enzyme that stimulates melanin production) inhibitor.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, have <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/2026568\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anti-carcinogenic properties</a> and may help prevent skin cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Antioxidants aren\u2019t all cast in the same mold. While they\u2019re all designed to protect the cells from UV light, pollution and other environmental elements that produce damaging free radicals, some are found to be more potent than others. Here are just some of the most popular antioxidants found in your skin care products:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever wondered how you used to pull an all-nighter with no hint of fatigue on your skin the next day? Well, thanks to the abundant supply of coenzymeQ10 or coQ10 in your body, those late nights didn\u2019t take a toll on your skin\u2014back then that is. But as we age, the presence of coenzymeQ10, also known as ubiquinone, in our body slowly diminishes, making us more susceptible to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10416055\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wrinkles</a> and photo-aging. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4737275/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Research</a> shows that an increased topical application of this antioxidant helps fight off free radical damage and keep your skin cells healthy. This nutrient is easily absorbed by the skin and helps stimulate collagen production, which helps improve elasticity and texture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A well-functioning epidermis is essential to protect us from free radicals. The more our epidermal lipid barrier is stabilized, the more it can fully absorb the vitamins and nutrients from our skin care products and achieve optimal results. However, as we age, our skin\u2019s ability to heal and retain moisture weakens, leaving us prone to wrinkles, fine lines, hyperpigmentation and dullness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cNiacinamide, also known as vitamin B3, is a powerful antioxidant that improves the skin\u2019s texture and tone. It reduces <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16029679\">fine lines, wrinkles</a>\u00a0and hyperpigmentation and exhibits anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d explains Dr. Klein.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Water-soluble and suitable for all skin types, this vitamin is often used to treat skin conditions like rosacea and acne and is not known to cause any adverse reactions. It can even be combined with your favorite skin care products and ingredients, like vitamins A and C, retinol and hydroxy acids to boost their performance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Great news: That one glass of wine at happy hour and your secret stash of chocolate can help save your skin, all thanks to polyphenol. This plant-based vitamin, which can be found in vegetables, green tea, fruits and chocolates, contains chemopreventive properties that \u201cpossess anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties to prevent UV-induced skin photodamage,\u201d Dr. Klein explains. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2813915/\">Studies</a> show that consumption and topical use of ingredients rich in polyphenol help improve our skin\u2019s natural defense against oxidative stress, prevent skin aging and may inhibit skin cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dermatologists continue to see the importance of including botanicals in skin care. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2958188/\">Studies</a> show that flavonoids, an antioxidant found in green and black teas, have the potential to treat rosacea, reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. \u201cFlavonoids absorb UV light and modulate signaling pathways that influence cellular function to prevent photoaging and damage,\u201d explains Dr. Klein. These nutrients also help <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583892/\">reduce collagen</a> degradation, delay skin aging and inhibit skin cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant that aids in cell repair and protection of vital organs like liver, kidney, brain and the skin. One of its wide-known side effects is its antimelanogenic property that causes <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207440/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">skin whitening</a>. This \u201cmother of all antioxidants\u201d helps detoxify the skin and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207440/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reduces the appearance of wrinkles</a>, giving you smoother, more supple skin. Research also shows that when taken orally, glutathione can help combat <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28789631\">liver disease.</a></p>"},

That said, there are a few things you can do about it. For one, it\u2019s important to know what causes oily skin to occur. Contrary to what you might think, there are several lifestyle factors that might have something to do with the excess oil wreaking havoc on your complexion. According to board-certified dermatologist, <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, hormones, stress and climate are all key factors in the causes of oily skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe worst climate for oily skin is very hot, humid and tropical conditions,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cWhen it is very hot there is an overgrowth of bacteria [which] tends to break the skin out,\u201d she adds. While we don\u2019t always have control over what climate we are in, there are some ways to combat the effects of it. For starters, Dr. Jaliman says to avoid certain ingredients like coconut oil, wheat germ oil and other comedogenic ingredients, as they \u201ccan be too greasy for oily skin and will clog your pores, especially if you are already oily.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want an oily skin\u2013friendly facial oil, Dr. Jaliman suggests trying <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Jojoba_502244.htm\">jojoba oil</a>, as \u201cits structure is similar to that of your skin\u2019s own sebum, so it\u2019s more suitable for oily and acne-prone skin.\u201d In addition, she recommends using products formulated with geranium essential oil because \u201cit can help control the sebum production in your skin, [making it] suitable for oily skin types.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Jaliman, hormones can also play a major role in the production of excess sebum. \u201cFluctuating hormones can result in increased androgen levels which can cause oily skin,\u201d she says. For example, \u201cWhen you are on your menstrual cycle, your oil glands are stimulated due to a change in hormones\u2014which may cause oily skin.\u201d If you are experiencing oily skin caused by fluctuating hormones, the first thing you should do is consult your doctor, as they can help create a customized game plan to help get things back on track.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to consulting your doctor, you\u2019ll want to stay away from some of the comedogenic ingredients previously mentioned. Plus, \u201cLook for products formulated with salicylic acid, glycolic acid and aloe,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. She also suggests avoiding products formulated with oil, as those tend to be comedogenic, meaning they can clog pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Can we all agree that stress is the ultimate enemy? These days, stress is all around us, wreaking havoc on our lives, and, as it turns out, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/signs-and-symptoms-of-stress/\">making our skin worse</a>\u00a0too. Furthermore, one major impact stress has on the skin is actually its impact on our hormones (go figure!). \u201cStress can cause hormonal changes,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cThis can lead to an increase in the production of oil from oil glands,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While some products can help combat the effect of oil overdrive, they can\u2019t target the root cause\u2014aka, the stress. With that in mind, you might want to consider taking a closer look at what is causing your stress. Once you\u2019ve determined where your stress lives, seek ways to ease the impact it has on your life. Some of our favorite ways to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/holiday-stress-relievers/\">reduce stress</a> are meditation, yoga, taking a relaxing bath, turning our phones off and reading a book.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the causes of oily skin, knowing what types of products to buy can be super helpful in your quest for clearer, less oily skin. We share some of the best products to combat excess oil, ahead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shopping for an everyday sunscreen can prove to be quite the challenge\u2014especially for those with oily skin. With that in mind, Dr. Jaliman suggests looking for \u201cproducts labeled as oil-free and non-comedogenic,\u201d or, in other words, products formulated for acne-prone skin. EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 is enriched with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Lactic+Acid_300061.htm#expand\">lactic acid</a>, which is known for its ability to gently exfoliate the surface of the skin. Using products formulated with exfoliating ingredients like lactic acid can allow products to better penetrate the skin, rather than float on the surface and cause more buildup of oils.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those with oily skin can benefit from the use of weekly at-home mask treatments, such as GlamGlow\u2019s YOUTHMUD Tinglexfoliate Treatment. Formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-of-matcha/\">green tea</a>\u2014a popular oily skin\u2013friendly ingredient\u2014volcanic rock and French sea clay, the deep-cleansing facial mask can help rid the skin\u2019s surface of excess oil buildup and reveal a cleaner, fresher, more refined-looking complexion post-facial.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s a difference between shine and glowing skin and Peter Thomas Roth Max Anti-Shine Mattifying Gel exists to help you achieve the latter without adding to the mess of excess oil. Thanks to its lightweight formula and mattifying effect, the gel treatment can help minimize the look of pores, absorb excess oil and allow for a fresher makeup application.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to shopping for oily skin\u2013friendly products, reading the labels is important. That said, sometimes the name alone can tell you if it was made for your skin type. Case in point: Dermalogica MediBac Clearing Oil Control Lotion. In addition to its name, the oily skin lotion is formulated with salicylic acid\u2014an ingredient Dr. Jaliman recommends looking out for. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Salicylic+Acid_500034.htm#expand\">Salicylic acid</a> is a beta hydroxy acid (BHA) that can gently exfoliate the surface of the skin and support cellular turnover, promoting a clearer-looking complexion, and minimize the appearance of large pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Per Dr. Jaliman\u2019s advice about products labeled oil-free, Avene Oil-Free Gel Cleanser can be a great option for those who experience a buildup of sebum on the regular. The lightweight gel cleanser works hard to gently rid the skin of dirt and excess oil from the day\u2019s grind, revealing a softer, smoother, more refreshed-looking complexion post-cleanse. In addition, its formula contains Avene Thermal Spring Water, which can soothe the skin and have a mattifying effect on the complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Made with oily and combination skin types in mind, SkinCeuticals Daily Moisture can provide the skin with a hydration boost, sans the oil slick. Enriched with a blend of algae extracts, vitamin E and witch hazel, the daily moisturizer pairs well with oily or combination skin as it protects against environmental aggressors, tones the complexion, helps balance oil production and even refines the look of pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your search for a peel-off face mask for oily skin ends here. Enriched with mineral-rich red clay, licorice root, vitamin C and probiotics, First Aid Beauty\u2019s Skin Rescue Purifying Mask With Red Clay acts like a magnet to draw impurities away from the surface of the skin while helping to deep-clean the complexion, target breakout-causing aggressors and promote a clearer, more even-looking complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cleansing the skin is important, especially for those prone to excess oil and breakouts. That said, sometimes your hands alone won\u2019t cut it. That\u2019s where the FOREO LUNA for Combination Skin comes into play. Made for complexions that experience both dry and oily areas, the silicone facial-cleansing brush uses T-sonic technology to gently massage the skin, exfoliate the complexion and get rid of pore-clogging dirt and debris in one simple step. Pair it with your favorite face wash and you won\u2019t be sorry.</p>"},

If you haven\u2019t heard of or tried it before, it\u2019s a synthetic organic compound and skin brightening agent\u00a0 present in many brightening serums and creams that promises to lighten dark patches. While some dermatologists recommend it as an effective way to address hyperpigmentation and even skin tone, it\u2019s not without controversy. In fact, it\u2019s already banned in the E.U., Japan, Australia and high concentrations of it are only available by prescription in the United States and Canada. So is hydroquinone your skin\u2019s friend or foe? Read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is hydroquinone, exactly? \u00a0\u201cHydroquinone is a common ingredient used in skin care to lighten the skin or get rid of dark spots or discoloration,\u201d explains Dr. Purvisha Patel, a board-certified dermatologist in Tennessee and founder of <a href=\"https://www.vishaskincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visha Skincare</a>. \u201cAs we age, people of all skin types get areas of discoloration either from the sun or as the form of skin darkening from scaring. Hydroquinone can be used in strong percentages that are prescription and in lower percentages over the counter to lighten age spots, sun spots and scarring,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simply put, hydroquinone works by blockading a key enzyme along the melanin (pigment) producing pathway in the body, adds Dr. Craig Kraffert, a board-certified dermatologist in Redding, California and President of <a href=\"http://www.amarteskincare.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amarte Skincare</a>. \u201cIt is one of the most (if not the most) effective skin brightening agents available,\u201d he says. \u201cStudies have shown that combining hydroquinone with retinoids and corticosteroids results in brightening that exceeds any one ingredient alone,\u201d Kraffert notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although hydroquinone seems like a miracle solution to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skinceuticals-discoloration-defense/\">get rid of dark spots once and for all</a>, dermatologists don\u2019t all agree about its safety or efficacy. \u201cHydroquinone is not universally considered safe,\u201d warns Kraffert. \u201cIt\u2019s a frequent skin irritant and is associated with altered immune function and increased incidence of certain malignancies (cancers) in animals,\u201d he adds. Patel notes that cancer risk was enough to lead to a ban in some countries. \u201cThis ingredient is banned in the E.U. because of the potential carcinogenic effects,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere\u2019s also a phenomenon called ochronosis, or increased pigmentation/darkening of the skin that is caused by hydroquinone in high concentrations and with long-term use,\u201d Patel adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the United States, hydroquinone is still available over the counter. But take note: \u201cThe FDA has expressed ongoing concerns regarding the potential mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of this chemical,\u201d says Kraffert. \u201cWhile the ingredient is generally considered safe and effective, there are more long-term safety concerns with this ingredient than most skin care actives,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the United States, you can find hydroquinone in products over the counter in two percent (low concentration) formulas and your dermatologist can write you a prescription for four percent formulas and higher. (Use of those higher concentrations need to be closely monitored by your doctor, though.) \u201cIt is safe to use in two percent and four percent formulations twice a day for 12 weeks max,\u201d says Patel. \u201cThe skin then needs a break from the chemical,\u201d she notes. Also, sunscreen with at least SPF 30 is <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/sunscreen-myths-debunked/\">a must every day</a> you\u2019re using it and even after receiving treatment to counter the skin from getting darker again, she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for starting a hydroquinone regimen, Kraffert says dermatologists have two different approaches: One option is to use mild, lower concentration hydroquinone products along with other products containing brightening ingredients. The other option is going with very high (ex. 8 percent) hydroquinone creams with or without other brightening agents mixed in. \u201cThe irritancy potential for these potent products is very high, but they do tend to work more quickly and effectively,\u201d he explains. If you\u2019re interested in using hydroquinone, it\u2019s best to work with your dermatologist who can make a recommendation on what will work best for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re concerned about the safety factor and looking for an alternative to hydroquinone, Kraffert recommends looking for the ingredient arbutin in skin care products instead. \u201cArbutin is a naturally occurring cousin to hydroquinone with excellent brightening properties,\u201d he says. \u201cArbutin has a low irritancy risk and isn\u2019t linked to a higher risk for cancers,\u201d Kraffert notes. Other hydroquinone-free alternatives feature natural skin brighteners, including\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Kojic+Acid_503556.htm\">kojic acid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a>, niacinamide, papaya enzymes, licorice and gigawhite.</p>"},

And for good reason.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lightweight and efficient, serums contain a potent blend of targeted active ingredients formulated for a specific purpose, says facial plastic surgeon <a href=\"https://www.nosedoc.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kay Durairaj</a>. \u201cThey\u2019re great for anyone who wants a quick and easy product that absorbs quickly into the skin, has a high concentration of ingredients and is non-greasy,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given the wide variety of serum treatments available and the fact that there is a serum for just about <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-are-face-serums/\">every skin concern</a> you may have, it almost feels like a disservice to choose just one\u2014not to mention, nearly impossible. Fortunately, that doesn\u2019t have to be the case. It is, however, important to understand how to layer serums and oils in order to get the most out of them.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help you get started, here are a few tips to keep in mind when applying serums and oils.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As a rule, serums should be the first products that touch your skin after cleansing and exfoliating in order to get the best results. Never apply them after your moisturizer as thicker creams and oils create a protective layer over your skin and hinder absorption.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The great thing about serums and oils is that they are team players. They can be mixed and work well together, especially if you have a number of skin care woes that need addressing, says board-certified dermatologist Craig Austin, creator of medical-grade skin care line <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cane+and+Austin_501890.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cane + Austin</a>. \u201cFor example, you can layer a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">vitamin C serum</a> for dark spots with a squalene serum for hydration,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While there is no limit to how many serums you can add to your regimen, esthetician Enrique Ramirez, founder of <a href=\"http://www.facetofacenyc.com/\">Face to Face NYC</a>, suggests stopping at three. Piling on more products than that is not only time-consuming, it also reduces the chances of each ingredient getting properly absorbed by your skin. If you\u2019re trying to target several concerns, opt for a multitasking serum to address general problems (like dryness or oiliness) and add one or two that targets more pressing concerns like fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to deciding which serum goes first, Dr. Austin says the rule of thumb is to always start light. \u201cAlways layer by consistency. Lighter serums will be easily and quickly absorbed while the heavier hydration serums/oils seal in the ingredients and leave your skin soft,\u201d explains Dr. Austin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For serums that have more or less the same consistency, go with the ingredient that you want your skin to get the most of. If your biggest concerns are <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-best-serums-to-try-for-brighter-skin/\">dark spots</a> and signs of aging, apply your vitamin C or retinol serum first.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you feel that layering multiple serums takes up too much of your time, then \u201ccocktailing\u201d may be the solution, says beauty chemist and skin care expert <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Pollock</a>. \u201cThat\u2019s when you mix a few items to create your favorite combination and save time,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But that doesn\u2019t mean you can throw your 10-step regimen out the window and just concoct your own skin care potion with everything in the mix. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t suggest mixing peels, retinol or acne-treatment products. You want to use those products on their own or in layers, applying them first,\u201d says Pollock.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Gently massaging your face as you apply your serums can help improve circulation, says Ramirez<strong>. </strong>Not only that, it also delivers a fresh dose of oxygen to the skin, which Ramirez says is the \u201cbest serum or oil out there.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some experts would argue that your skin can effectively absorb the products you apply whether or not you wait, but it still pays to be thorough. Waiting a minute or two will not only ensure that your serums have fully seeped into your skin, it also prevents pilling (that\u2019s when products start to ball up or rub off) when you apply your moisturizer or sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As long as you\u2019re choosing the right products for your skin type, Dr. Austin says everyone can benefit from using and layering serums. \u201cYou\u2019re treating the skin with a targeted ingredient and then sealing it in with a barrier that will help to heal and hydrate your skin,\u201d explains Dr. Austin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In particular, Ramirez recommends using multiple serums especially for those with mature skin as it requires stronger and more potent ingredients to repair and strengthen the skin after collagen starts to break down.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/ingredients-to-avoid-in-skin-care/\">Certain ingredients</a> in your serums\u2014like retinol and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-hydroquinone-and-is-it-safe/\">hydroquinone</a>\u2014may cause some sensitivity to your skin when exposed to ultraviolet rays, so it\u2019s best to do your layers and cocktails in the PM, says Dr. Austin. Not only that, you\u2019re also allowing your skin care products to work more effectively as your body repairs itself in your sleep. But if you want to layer serums in the morning, make sure your skin is well-protected with a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">broad-spectrum sunscreen</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s always exciting to try something new, says Pollock, and experimenting allows you to discover what really works best for your skin. \u201cOtherwise, you may only use one item and rotate it, limiting the benefit your skin might receive from other ingredients,\u201d he adds.</p>"},

Developed by cosmetic chemist, product formulator and brand founder Sunday Riley (yes, she\u2019s a real person), Good Genes is a lactic acid serum formulated to instantly transform your complexion while providing long-term payoff.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sound too good to be true? We think not. With more than 150 5-star reviews and counting, it\u2019s a favorite among Dermstore shoppers\u2014and here are some of the reasons why.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Search for \u201cSunday Riley Good Genes\u201d on Google or Reddit, and you\u2019ll find discussion after discussion on \u201cdupes\u201d or alternatives for this serum. People are on a mission to find a lactic acid serum that performs as well as Good Genes\u2014without paying full price.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Dermstore shopper shares her experience: \u201cMy love for Good Genes is genuine and complete\u2026except for the price. I\u2019ve gone so far as to research online whether or not there\u2019s an adequate duplicate, or a way to replicate Good Genes\u2019 results without the cost\u2014and <em>everything I\u2019ve discovered indicates that there isn\u2019t</em>.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The reason these discussions keep happening and dupes miss the mark is because Good Genes is such a uniquely powerful product. One reviewer admits, \u201cI am now a believer that when it comes to skin care, you really do get what you pay for.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, many of the benefits of Good Genes come from lactic acid, but that\u2019s not the only factor to consider. Good Genes works because of the superior quality of ingredients\u2014like purified, unneutralized lactic acid and surgical-grade filtered water. And when the active ingredients are blended with botanicals, the result is a potent formula that soothes the skin instead of irritating it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take it from another skeptic-turned-believer: \u201cI have no idea why this combination of ingredients does what it does for my skin but it\u2019s so clear and glowing that not buying it isn\u2019t an option.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re familiar with how most\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">alpha hydroxy acids</a> (AHAs), such as glycolic acid, work, you\u2019re probably familiar with the potential side effects. From redness and inflammation to dryness and flakiness, AHAs can do a number on your skin\u2014if you overdo it or have sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By using lactic acid (a milder AHA) instead of glycolic acid, Good Genes reduces the chance of a skin reaction. That\u2019s because lactic acid molecules are slightly larger, so they\u2019re a little gentler on your skin. \u201cI can\u2019t use acids for the most part because they are always too strong,\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cThis one is wonderful for every other to everyday use.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the lactic acid is one part of the formula, the other is the inclusion of soothing botanicals like aloe, prickly pear extract and cactus extract. At the same time you\u2019re exfoliating, you\u2019re also hydrating and soothing your skin. Sunday Riley chose these ingredients to create a truly universal serum\u2014suitable even for dry/dehydrated, acne-prone and rosacea-prone skin types.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take it from our reviewers:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have very sensitive, acne-prone, but also dry skin,\u201d says one Dermstore shopper. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me to find products that work for my skin type that aren\u2019t too harsh, too drying or not effective enough. This somehow strikes the perfect balance. Really has done wonders for my skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI have combination (normal/oily) skin, with leftover hyperpigmentation and subtle redness on cheeks,\u201d says another. \u201cI\u2019ve been using this for exactly a week religiously every night and some mornings and I cannot believe how good my skin looks! Hyperpigmentation is 60% faded from a week ago. Zero redness in the morning, soft skin, brighter, and I have a couple scars from acne as well that have dramatically decreased.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need your skin to glow right before a big event? Whip yourself up a little \u201cflash facial\u201d by mixing your Good Genes with Sunday Riley\u2019s Ceramic Slip Clay Cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Combine one pump of Good Genes with a quarter-size amount of Ceramic Slip and apply to your entire face. Leave on for up to 10 minutes, rinse with water and follow with your favorite serum and moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When purified lactic acid, French green clay, licorice and vitamin C combine, the result is a quick-fix mask that exfoliates, cleanses and instantly restores radiance to the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to try it? The <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Flash+Fix+Kit_76286.htm\">Flash Fix Kit</a> includes trial sizes of both products!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Glow, baby, glow! Our reviewers love what this serum does for their appearance\u2014both instantly and with long-term use. \u201cI\u2019ve tried literally every product targeting acne but nothing really works,\u201d said one reviewer. \u201cBut with this Sunday Riley Good Genes, my skin is clear and glowing.

You aren\u2019t the only one experiencing breakouts these days. While teenage acne is, of course, common, it\u2019s more shocking to hear that </span><a href=\"http://www.dermalinstitute.com/us/library/13_article_Why_is_Adult_Acne_on_the_Rise_.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">54 percent of women</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> age 25 and older experience facial acne. And according to the International Dermal Institute, clinical studies show that between </span><a href=\"http://www.dermalinstitute.com/us/library/13_article_Why_is_Adult_Acne_on_the_Rise_.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">40 and 55 percent</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the adult population are diagnosed with low-grade, persistent acne and/or oily skin at some point. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, treatments are readily available. The hardest part may be identifying the types of products and medications that work best for your skin. To help, we\u2019ve enlisted top dermatologists to put together a guide to common types of acne and the best options for treatment. Clear skin, here you come. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s clear that more adults are breaking out these days, it\u2019s not always clear what is causing the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-causes-adult-acne/\">surge in adult acne</a>. \u201cAcne can be caused by a wide range of things,\u201d says </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Paul Lorenc, board-certified aesthetic plastic surgeon in New York City. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hormonal acne is more common in women and happens during puberty. There\u2019s also acne caused by rosacea, stress, certain medications and bad hygiene.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scientifically speaking, there\u2019s a lot going on underneath the skin that leads to breakouts, adds <a href=\"https://www.drheathersbeautyblog.com/\">Dr. Heather Woolery-Lloyd</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in Miami. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBasically, the \u2018pores\u2019 in our skin are lined by skin cells called keratinocytes. In normal skin, those keratinocytes naturally slough out of the pore easily. However, in acne, the keratocytes become very sticky and they build up in the lining of the pore to form a pimple,\u201d she explains. \u201cThis looks like a whitehead or blackhead. Many things can cause the lining of the pore to get sticky.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most commonly, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-causes-breakouts/\">hormones are the culprit</a>, Lloyd says. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll likely notice breakouts around your monthly cycle. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the lining of the pore becomes more sticky, oil and bacteria build up inside of the pore. This is when you see papules and cysts under the skin.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re hoping to treat breakouts, you\u2019ll first need to identify the \u201ctype\u201d of acne you\u2019re suffering from.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common way to categorize acne is inflammatory vs. non-inflammatory,\u201d explains Lloyd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The difference will likely be obvious.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cNon-inflammatory acne has no significant redness or inflammation\u2014you\u2019ll see whiteheads and blackheads. With inflammatory acne, papules, pustules, nodules and cysts are present. Nodules and cysts are seen in more severe acne.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lloyd says the easiest way to check for inflammatory acne is to look for the following: </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Papules: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually appear as pink or red bumps, varying in size. There\u2019s no fluid inside of these and they are usually painless, unless you irritate them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Pustules:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This type of acne goes deeper into the skin than papules. They appear yellow or white and contain pus.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Nodules: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appear as large, painful bumps filled with blood or pus.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Cysts: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Appear as red bumps that contain pus. This is the most severe form of acne and can be quite irritating.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Non-inflammatory acne treatments</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mild, non-inflammatory acne can usually be treated at home with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/salicylic-acid-products/\">products containing salicylic acid</a>, says Lorenc.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also look for over-the-counter products containing <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-benzoyl-peroxide/\">benzoyl peroxide</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydroxy-acids-what-they-do-and-which-ones-are-right-for-you/\">alpha hydroxy acids</a> (AHAs) and adapalene, recommends Lloyd.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Hormonal acne treatments</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you have hormonal acne, you can speak to your doctor and see if they\u2019ll put you on birth control or a pill like Spironolactone,\u201d recommends Lorenc. \u201cIf your acne is severe, you might want to consult a doctor about Accutane or other acne medication.\u201d (Note, these medications do come with side effects.) </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Severe, inflammatory acne treatments</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFor more severe acne with nodules and cysts, prescription treatments like antibiotics, topical retinoids and isotretinoin are used,\u201d explains Lloyd.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Other options</b></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talking to your dermatologist about how to best treat your acne may be your best bet. \u201cThere is a wide range of prescription topical and oral medications, but they require a consultation with a medical professional,\u201d explains Lorenc. In-office, he says aestheticians can perform a range of treatments that may help, including chemical peels, facials, laser and dermal filler treatments.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At home, you can treat scars and dark marks acne leaves behind, too. \u201cIf you\u2019re left with dark marks from your acne, use <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-best-serums-to-try-for-brighter-skin/\">products with botanical brightening ingredients</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">retinol</a>,\u201d recommends Lloyd. \u201cI also suggest using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">product with SPF</a> because acne marks can get darker over time when exposed to sunlight.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t give up on your cleansers and other favorite products, either. \u201cAll things considered, it\u2019s important to maintain a good skin care regimen throughout any course of treatment,\u201d Lorenc says.</span></p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/post-procedure-skin-care-skinmedica/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">How to Build a Post-Procedure Skin Care Regimen With SkinMedica</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Lindsay Tigar \u00b7 June 28, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A visit to your esthetician, whether for a quick pick-me-up facial or a deep pore cleanse, is always a refreshing experience. But when booking a treatment that\u2019s slightly or significantly more intense\u2014like microdermabrasion or a chemical peel\u2014it can be difficult to know exactly what to do once you\u2019re out of your esthetician\u2019s office. Though it would be ideal if these treatments work like magic overnight, it is often the care that follows these appointments that make a difference in our skin. After all, much like you\u2019d recover from anything that changed your body in some way, your pores need extra TLC to heal, repair and reveal smoother, brighter skin underneath.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One way to ensure the health and vitality of your skin and extend the results of your treatments is by creating a dermatologist-recommended post-procedure regimen. One of the brands trusted by many professionals? <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinMedica_100155.htm\">SkinMedica</a>, a dermatologist-founded skin care brand that leverages decades of scientific research and clinically tested ingredients to formulate advanced skin care products that deliver optimal results. \u201cThe products do exactly what they say they will do, and I appreciate their dedication to innovation! When we discuss the necessities everyone should have in their routine, SkinMedica actually has them all,\u201d esthetician <u><a href=\"https://www.completeskinmd.com/pages/jordana-mattioli-le\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jordana Mattioli</a></u> explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re wondering which SkinMedica products to use after common minimally invasive treatments like microdermabrasion and chemical peels, read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What happens</strong>: During this procedure, Mattioli explains, desquamating corneocytes on the stratum corneum (a.k.a.\u2014acne scars!) are removed, revealing softer, smoother and brighter skin. Because of the vacuum component of this treatment, microcirculation is stimulated, helping to unclog our pores. Right afterwards, you\u2019ll notice pinker skin, which can last a few minutes or a few hours, depending on sensitivity. For the best results, most people have a series of these sessions to rid of scarring or other issues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What to do</strong>: Because these methods don\u2019t enter the deeper-living layers of the skin, Mattioli says you don\u2019t have to be too specific about your post-care. Though it is important to avoid retinoids and acids for 24 hours, it is most important to be diligent with sunscreen, since your skin could be extra sensitive to vitamin D.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try this product:</strong> For everyday use and after any procedure, Mattioli recommends <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Essential+Defense+Mineral+Shield+Broad+Spectrum+SPF+35_66724.htm\">SkinMedica Daily Physical Defense\u00ae Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30</a></u>. Not only does it offer protection, but it goes on smoothly and absorbs fast, too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How they work: </strong>Also known as alpha and beta hydroxy acid peels, these won\u2019t cause your face to resemble the blotchy mess of Samantha\u2019s in <em>Sex &amp; the City\u2014</em>but rather, provide that youthful glow you\u2019re after. Mattioli explains that these types of mild peels work by dissolving the proteins that hold together skin cells, allowing you to shed easily. When you remove this outermost layer, you\u2019ll see softer and clearer skin. Like with microdermabrasion, you might notice that a bit of redness will appear but usually goes away swiftly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What to do</strong>: Technically speaking, Mattioli explains that even mild chemical peels do damage your skin slightly, but in a healthy way, to allow your brighter layer underneath to lead the way. Because of this, you might notice your skin is a tad more sensitive than normal. To ensure your pores are treated kindly, switch up your routine for the first week following treatment by using a gentle cleanser to keep skin clean and provide antiseptic and antibacterial support. You should also hydrate your skin with a smart moisturizer. And last\u2014but never least\u2014don\u2019t forget daily sunscreen!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try these products</strong>: For washing your face once to twice a day after treatment, go for the water-and-oil\u2013based <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sensitive+Skin+Cleanser_2700.htm\">SkinMedica Sensitive Skin Cleanser</a></u> if you have dry skin or the water-soluble gel <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Facial+Cleanser_2701.htm\">Facial Cleanser</a></u> if you have normal-to-oily skin. Both are free of harsh agents, fragrances or irritants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With clean skin, Mattioli suggests using the <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_HA5+Rejuvenating+Hydrator_65761.htm\">SkinMedica HA5 moisturizer</a></u>, featuring a blend of hydrating ingredients and five types of hyaluronic acid. If your skin is super-dry post-treatment, you can also try the <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_TNS+Ceramide+Treatment+Cream_12126.htm\">SkinMedica TNS Ceramide Treatment Cream</a></u>, featuring growth factors, peptides, plant oils and antioxidants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After your first week, Mattioli says you can return to your previous routine using a low-strength retinol. Then, once a month has passed, you can also start to use alpha hydroxy acid twice a week. \u201cIn the mornings, use a growth factor cocktail and antioxidants under sunscreen. If you are concerned with keeping pigment away, also include a brightening product at night,\u201d she shares.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How they work</strong>: Mattioli explains that these chemical solutions are applied to remove specific skin layers, which are then eliminated over a period of several days. During this time, the repair mechanisms of your skin are induced, causing a thickening of your viable epidermis and thinning out our outermost layer of skin. This creates a wound that often reacts with an inflammatory response, in the form of swelling, redness and possible mild discomfort. Though probably not when you want to go on a first date, Mattioli stresses that inflammation is a critical part of the healing process, helping you to rebuild vitality. Two to three days later, you\u2019ll start to see a shift, and within a week, most of your reactions will subside. During this time, collagen fibers bundle together\u2014and you\u2019ll appear younger and more radiant.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What to do</strong>: You\u2019ll want to follow much of the same regimen as you do with lighter peels, but with a few other safety precautions. Mattioli warns against using scrubs, cleansing brushes, washcloths, retinoids, topical acne medication and alpha/beta hydroxy acids for a week, as these will all disrupt the healing process.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try these products</strong>: After using the cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen above, Mattioli says to make sure you fill your regimen with antioxidants in the morning and a fragrance-free serum that uses both vitamins C and E. When you receive clearance from your derm, you should also implement retinols, which Mattioli says are the key for healthy skin. Some to get you started include <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_TNS+Essential+Serum_16498.htm\">The Essential Serum</a></u> and the <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Age+Defense+Retinol+Complex+05_55451.htm\">SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex 0.5</a></u>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n            <script>\n            $(document).ready(function () {\n                $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n            });\n            </script>\n        </p>"},

Technically, it is all-natural, occurring as the mineral zincite, but it can also be produced synthetically or through chemical processing by human agency. Its most common and notable use is as a sunscreen agent, which it is FDA-approved for.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAs a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/mineral-sunscreen-vs-chemical-sunscreen/\">mineral-based sunscreen</a> active ingredient, zinc oxide reflects light off the surface of the skin where the sunscreen is applied back into the environment, much like a mirror,\u201d says Melanie D. Palm, M.D., San Diego\u2013based dermatologist, cosmetic surgeon and founding director of Art of Skin MD.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cZinc oxide can be \u2018micronized,\u2019 meaning it\u2019s processed into very small particles, so small that the preparation appears clear when applied on the skin.\u201d Non-micronized formulations, she explains, are often less cosmetically elegant and are more opaque or white. So, if you\u2019ve ever applied a sunscreen that left a white, powdery cast on your body, it most likely contained zinc oxide as a key ingredient.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help you further understand how this mineral plays a key role in your skin care regimen, especially in the sun-protection department, here are some commonly asked questions answered by top dermatologists.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Zinc oxide isn\u2019t the only sunscreen ingredient used to block harmful UVA and UVB rays. Many sunscreens contain an ingredient called titanium dioxide, which, like zinc oxide, is typically found in mineral sunscreens. It\u2019s also considered safe since it does not penetrate the skin and offers broad-spectrum protection against both UVA and UVB rays. Although, Francesca Fusco, M.D., dermatologist at Wexler Dermatology in New York City, points out that some studies have shown that titanium dioxide can work as a photosensitizer that can be absorbed by the skin. \u201cA safe bet is to look for sunscreens that are known to use particles too big to be absorbed, or those containing zinc oxide, which is the safest ingredient according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG).\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still, all four common sunscreen ingredients\u2014mineral-based zinc oxide and titanium oxide and chemical-based avobenzone and mexoryl SX (ecamsule)\u2014have been shown to be non-toxic when used on the skin and to not break down when exposed to the sun, which is vital. \u201cTitanium and zinc oxides are the best options on this list as they both block and protect against all UVA rays, whereas the other two don\u2019t provide as much protection,\u201d adds Dr. Fusco.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Surprisingly, not all sunscreens protect against both UVA and UVB rays. Zinc oxide, however, does. \u201cIt\u2019s a photostable, broad-spectrum sunscreen, so it has one of the broadest UVA coverages of all the sunscreen ingredients currently available in the U.S, as well as UVB coverage,\u201d says Sejal Shah, M.D., dermatologist and contributor to the cosmetic treatment site RealSelf.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When applied, zinc oxide\u2013containing sunscreens appear white on the skin, so they give a translucent, almost ghost-like appearance. This makes it especially difficult for use on patients with darker skin types. \u201cWhen you use higher concentrations to achieve high SPF values, the formulas are often tinted to mask the white discoloration it would leave on the skin otherwise,\u201d says Joshua Zeichner, M.D., director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019ve probably been told to wait at least 20 minutes between applying sunscreen and actually going outside to be in the sun. While this is true for some sunscreens, it is not necessary when using brands containing zinc oxide. \u201cBecause it is a physical blocker, it works as soon as you apply it, so technically it does not need to applied 15\u201330 minutes before sun exposure, as a chemical sunscreen does,\u201d explains Dr. Shah.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While zinc oxide is considered to be non-sensitizing and non-comedogenic, in rare cases it could cause a minor allergic reaction, according to Dr. Fusco.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since zinc oxide is used as a skin protectant, it rarely causes irritation on the skin, according to Dr. Zeichner. For this reason, it can be used on any skin type\u2014even on those with extremely sensitive skin. It is also non-comedogenic for the most part, which means it is very likely to cause breakouts or acne.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Basically, everybody. Anyone older than six months can use physical sunscreens that contain zinc oxide. \u201cSensitive-skin patients, rosacea patients and acne patients all benefit from the anti-inflammatory properties of zinc oxide,\u201d adds Dr. Palm. \u201cAdditionally, patients with skin discoloration, including melasma, will benefit, not only from zinc oxide\u2019s ability to block not only UV light, but also to block out visible and infrared light while not producing heat, which can aggravate pigmentary problems.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to use zinc oxide? Here, Dr. Palm shares some dos and don\u2019ts:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Check to see if the formulation is water-resistant and re-apply every 40\u201360 minutes as indicated by labeling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By then it can be too late. It\u2019s better to apply sunscreen while you\u2019re still indoors, even though zinc oxide works rather quickly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clear zinc oxide formulations are well-tolerated, and many, if you choose, have tint and can be used as a makeup primer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hands, neck and chest are <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/where-to-apply-sunscreen/\">frequently forgotten areas</a> that need sunscreen. Even minutes of exposure daily over a lifetime add up to unwanted UV exposure that can lead to skin changes and even increased incidence of skin cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A proper full body application requires 1-ounce ( a shot glass) for proper coverage. Most of us underapply by about 50 percent.</p>"},

From entertainment and music to food and fashion, more and more people look to the trend-setting Koreans for influence and inspiration\u2014and the world of beauty is no exception. In recent years, the Korean way of skin care, otherwise known as K-beauty, has been gaining considerable headway around the world\u2014and for good reason.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from wowing us with their impeccably radiant skin, Koreans have introduced us to the wonders of sheet masks and snail mucin and prompted our curiosity for their famed 10-step skin care regimen. But for all our fascination with K-beauty, there remains a certain mystique around it that many of us have yet to decode. Take the products Koreans use, for example. We\u2019re quite familiar with toners and serums, but essences and beauty water don\u2019t seem to fall under any of the categories we already know. To help us demystify and understand the hallmarks of Korean skin care, we chatted with beauty blogger and K-beauty expert Renee of <a href=\"https://www.gothamista.com/\">Gothamista</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Korean skin care may be known for its unexpected ingredients (bee venom, anyone?), fun packaging and products that feel nothing short of luxury for your skin, but the true essence of K-beauty lies in its long-term and highly personal approach to skin health. Unlike Western skin care, which is conventionally focused on repairing imperfections, Korean women put emphasis on preserving their skin and protecting it from environmental aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Koreans see skin care more as part of holistic health rather than as a beauty measure. As such, their skin care routines focus on hydration and nourishing the skin from the inside out to produce lifelong results and achieve that coveted dewy glow or \u201cglass skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAsian beauty, in general, is about introducing light layers of hydration in every step,\u201d explains Renee. \u201cThe Korean skin care routine involves multiple light layers rather than one heavy one,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This principle is most evident in the 10-step regimen that has most K-beauty fans and curious onlookers fascinated. While the multistep routine is flexible enough to be reduced to five or increased to as many as 15\u2014because, as we learned from the Koreans, skin care is all about listening to what your skin actually needs as opposed to piling on products simply for the sake of\u2014hydration remains at its core.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In developing the most effective skin care products, Koreans put to good use their rich traditions and historical knowledge of the best nature-derived ingredients and marry them with state-of-the-art technology and science-backed innovations. The result? A wide variety of groundbreaking skin care products and formulations, unlike anything the rest of the world has seen. This is key as Korean women (and men), who belong to the <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/a-bright-future-south-korea-ranks-among-the-top-10-beauty-markets-globally\">top 10 global beauty market as of 2017</a>, demand the best beauty products that will fit seamlessly into their unique skin care regimen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The obsession with Korean beauty products doesn\u2019t come unwarranted. By fusing breakthrough technology with a beauty heritage that spans generations, we can safely say that these skin care wonders are in a league of their own. Below, Renee gives us a rundown of the most buzzworthy K-beauty essentials.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u>Essence</u></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is: </strong>Essence is one of the beauty products that is uniquely Korean, and according to Renee, it comes in two types. First-treatment essence \u201cusually contains a high concentration of fermented ingredients and are to be the first product you apply on your skin right after cleansing,\u201d she explains. Because of its watery formula, this type of essence is perfectly suited to prep your skin to allow for better absorption of other products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The second type, on the other hand, is \u201cmore like a cross between a toner and a serum,\u201d says Renee, and combines the functions of both products: It targets specific concerns while keeping your skin hydrated.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Common ingredients: </strong>Essences usually contain galactomyces or saccharomyces ferment filtrate, which are yeast-based filtrates that help address a host of skin concerns\u2014from oiliness and acne to uneven texture and premature aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Who it\u2019s best for: </strong>All skin types. Whether you have normal or dehydrated skin, an essence is a crucial first step and is the center of any K-beauty regimen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u>Toner</u></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is: </strong>Traditionally, toners take on the role of balancing your skin\u2019s pH level after it goes through makeup, cleansing and exfoliation. But in K-beauty, toners serve a different function, says Renee. \u201cIt focuses on hydrating the skin and replenishing what was lost during the cleansing process,\u201d she explains. In fact, picking out the right toner is an important step in the famed multistep K-beauty regimen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Common ingredients: </strong>Because toners provide the skin with a base layer of hydration in Korean skin care, they are mostly infused with ultra-hydrating ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a>, sodium hyaluronate and centella asiatica or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-gotu-kola/\">gotu kola</a>. Aside from their ability to attract and deliver moisture into the skin, these ingredients also provide anti-aging and skin-healing benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Who it\u2019s best for: </strong>Hydration is key regardless of your skin type, making toners a skin care must-have if you plan on starting your own K-beauty regimen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u>Serum and Ampoule</u></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While ampoules are marketed as the supercharged version of serums (containing a higher concentration of actives and only meant to be used over a certain period of time), both products share the same function, says Renee.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThese tend to be concentrated products that are focused on treating specific skin concerns and needs such as youth-preserving, acne, hyperpigmentation, dryness, oiliness and sensitivity,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Common ingredients: </strong>There\u2019s a serum or ampoule for every skin concern and most of these potent skin-savers are formulated with multitasking ingredients like peptides, niacinamide and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a> that aid in restoring skin, boosting collagen production and providing antioxidant benefits. These products are also infused with ingredients that are unique to Korean skin care, such as snail mucin and bee venom (both known for their anti-aging properties) and plant-derived extracts (gotu kola and tea tree, to name a few).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Who it\u2019s best for: </strong>Serums and ampoules address specific skin concerns and are formulated according to one\u2019s skin type. They are particularly helpful for those who want to target multiple skin concerns at once or are undergoing a skin crisis.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><strong><u>Beauty Water</u></strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is: </strong>Skin care in a bottle is perhaps the aptest way one can describe beauty water. Aside from cleansing and prepping your skin for the next steps of your regimen, this multitasking K-beauty staple also acts as a balancing toner, hydration booster and gentle exfoliator. You can even use it as a skin-refreshing facial mist when you\u2019re on the go!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Common ingredients: </strong>Beauty waters are infused with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/lavender-benefits-for-skin/\">lavender</a> and rose petals, which are known for their calming, hydrating and rejuvenating benefits. They also feature gentle exfoliants and skin-brighteners like willow bark and papaya extracts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Who it\u2019s best for: </strong>Formulated with gentle and natural ingredients, beauty waters are perfect to use for all skin types. In particular, those with oily or sensitive skin can benefit from incorporating beauty water into their regimen as it provides the skin with instant hydration without the grease or the risk of irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get the most out of your skin care products, it\u2019s crucial to know when to apply them and the order in which they go on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMy general principle for layering is to start with the thinnest consistency to thickest\u2014water-based, liquid-y products before oil-based and creamy ones,\u201d explains Renee. \u201cThis sounds like a lot of work if you are used to a two-step routine of washing your face then moisturizing, but the results are so worth it!\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get you started, here is a guide on when and how to apply these Korean skin care staples:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the morning, targeted products are followed by an eye cream, moisturizer and broad spectrum SPF. Nighttime routines typically involve a sheet mask after you apply your serums and ampoules and a sleeping pack after moisturizing.</p>"},

From transitioning from the single life to the married, to saving money for weekend getaways to preparing for retirement\u2014age inevitably requires transformation. The same is true for your skin: <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-routine-20s/\">what you needed at 20-something</a> isn\u2019t what your pores crave as you weed through your <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-in-your-30s/\">30s</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-routine-40s/\">40s,</a>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-products-50-and-60/\">50s and beyond</a>. In addition to the basics of maintaining a healthy glow\u2014from sunscreen and moisturizer to serums and masks\u2014minimally invasive treatments can also work wonders in preventive care. Of the top picks by celebs and experts is hyaluronic acid fillers. Not sure if they\u2019re right for you? Let our guide help you figure it out.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re not schooled on chemistry\u2014no worries. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">Hyaluronic acid</a>\u00a0(HA) is a natural sugar that is found in our body that can hold up to 1,000 times its weight in water. When we are younger, we have plenty of it\u2014which is what keeps our skin vibrant and fresh. But over time, we lose this. That\u2019s why plastic surgeon Dr. Douglas Senderoff MD, FACS says this specific type of filler serves as a powerful humectant. \u201cIt keeps skin plump and hydrated by acting as a moisture-binding ingredient,\u201d he notes. When you receive this treatment, you\u2019ll experience fewer lines and wrinkles, and your pores will feel more refreshed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Papri Sarkar says these fillers are safe\u2014and recommended\u2014for every age. But most folks will probably start considering and using them regularly past the age of 30. She explains there is a broad range of different options that cater to anyone\u2019s specific needs. \u201cBased on the type your physician chooses, she can treat the lips, nasolabial folds, jawline, cheeks, tear troughs, temples, superficial scars or wrinkles, and even the back of the hands,\u201d she explains. They\u2019re also appropriate for men or women, so consider dragging your partner along for the experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you head to the dermatology office or to a trusted, trained aesthetic professional, plastic surgeon Z. Paul Lorenc, MD, FACS says you can expect to be in the office for around an hour. To begin, he says your doctor will apply a topical anesthetic to the area before injection, and sometimes, a block is administered to the lip area to ensure you feel little pain. Then, you\u2019ll be injected with the fillers, which only takes a few minutes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even though your visit to the derm might not be lengthy, Dr. Sarkar says preparation for the injection should begin a week before. As a rule, she asks her patients to avoid blood thinners like Aleve or Ibuprofen, as well as supplements like fish oil, ginkgo biloba, garlic and vitamin E. For the 24 hours leading up to the appointment, she also recommends avoiding alcohol. This ensures you\u2019ll have as little bruising or swelling as possible, and hopefully, the sting won\u2019t be as intense.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Depending on where you live, the price will vary, according to dermatologists. Dr. Lorenc, Dr. Sarkar and Dr. Senderoff all estimate a ballpark range of $600 to $1,200 dollars, and you\u2019ll see the price tag go up or down depending on which filler your doc recommends and the number of vials you\u2019ll need to see results. That being said, Dr. Lorenc says the treatment can last anywhere from nine months, all the way to 24 months. And Dr. Sarkar notes that most folks will see a difference\u2014right away. \u201cThe best part about HA fillers is that you see instant results. It really is like magic. Lips plump up before your eyes and eye bags disappear,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf you want a small change in one area, one treatment is usually enough. If you want a larger change, sometimes scheduling the filler over multiple sessions leads to a better and more natural-looking result.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since this treatment is less intense than other fillers on the market, Dr. Sarkar says side effects are usually minimal. The most common one she notices is redness or swelling, around day 2. Then, around day 3 to 4, you might notice a bit of lumpiness. \u201cThese all usually resolve by day 5 and patients are very happy by then. If there\u2019s a lot of swelling, I recommend an antihistamine,\u201d she shares.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While Dr. Senderoff says both injectable and topical HA are great for restoring volume to our skin, it is equally as important to maintain a smart skincare routine if you want results to last. He recommends daily sunscreen, along with a nighttime product that features active ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">glycolic acid</a>. Dr. Sarkar also suggests using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">retinol</a>, since this powerful antioxidant can treat fine lines, build collagen and even out skin tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re not ready to go for the needle, you might consider a topical cream that delivers similar results. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_HA5+Rejuvenating+Hydrator_65761.htm\">SkinMedica\u2019s HA5 line</a> has a slew of offerings that feature this ingredient and claim to prolong, if not mimic, this result\u2014but are they worth it? Dr. Sarkar says yes! Because it is a great hydrator, it will smooth the appearance of your skin when used consistently. That being said, it isn\u2019t a replacement, she adds: \u201cHyaluronic acid is a huge molecule that doesn\u2019t penetrate the skin barrier well when applied topically. Although silicones like dimethicone\u2014in SkinMedica HA5\u2014will smooth the skin, you won\u2019t get the replenished volume and plumpness that HA fillers deliver.\u201d</p>"},

That is, until you realize that the orange-tinged horizon is actually filtered with smog and that toxic chemicals regularly mingle in the air you breathe. We all know the devastating effects of pollution to the environment and to our health, but one thing we may not be aware of is that aside from our lungs, another organ that bears the brunt of the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-anti-aging-food-for-skin-and-hair/\">harmful effects of pollution</a> is our skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28195077\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2017 study,</a> experts found that aside from ultraviolet radiation, pollutants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (chemicals that are released when burning coal, gasoline, trash or tobacco), volatile organic compounds (present in paints, coatings and car exhausts, among others), oxides, particulate matter, ozone and cigarette smoke cause significant damage to the skin\u2014our body\u2019s largest organ and outermost barrier. These pollutants cause premature skin aging and conditions like acne, psoriasis and skin cancers to allergies and pigmentation. Pollution also heightens the dangers of free radicals, which disrupt collagen production and destroy the skin\u2019s natural barrier.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAir pollution consists of gas and particulate contaminants that are present in the atmosphere,\u201d explains Heather Hickman of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dermalogica_100083.htm\">Dermalogica</a>. \u201cThese pollutants come from a variety of sources and<span class=\"s3\">\u00a0can lead to inflammation and</span><span class=\"s3\">\u00a0can result in h</span><span class=\"s3\">yperpigmentation, d</span><span class=\"s3\">egradation of collagen that makes up the structural components of the skin, d</span><span class=\"s3\">ehydration and i</span><span class=\"s3\">ncreased sensitivity to the skin\u2014a phenomenon called <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/air-pollution-effects-inflammaging/\">inflammaging</a>.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cLike ultraviolet\u00a0and infrared\u00a0light, pollution or <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-atmospheric-aging/\">ground-level ozone induces oxidative stress</a>, damaging cellular structures\u2014proteins and lipids\u2014in the stratum corneum,\u201d adds Nicole Akers of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinCeuticals_100113.htm\">SkinCeuticals</a>. \u201cBut more than that, existing research also suggests that ozone depletes natural antioxidants on the skin, such as vitamins C and E.\u00a0As we know, antioxidants neutralize free-radical damage and oxidation that lead to collagen and other protein damage.\u00a0With depleted levels of antioxidants, skin is less able to defend itself from environmental aggression.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But if you think you\u2019re safe just because you live in a rural area or the suburbs, think again.

But before you go on a shopping spree to stock up, take a moment to consider what sunscreen actually does and how it works. While you already know you should be using it daily, you\u2019ve probably wondered how long it really lasts. Or if you can tan through sunscreen. Or if it does more harm than good on your little one. Luckily, dermatologists have broken down all of your burning questions so you can enjoy those summer days without\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/home-remedies-sunburn/\">worrying about sunburn</a>.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This depends on what type of sunscreen you\u2019re using, according to\u00a0dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"http://angelalambmd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Angela Lamb</a>. Some sunscreen products feature active ingredients that create a firm barrier from the sun, while other ingredients absorb UV rays instead of blocking them. Mineral or physical sunscreens feature z</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inc oxide and titanium dioxide, which physically block the sun, while active ingredients </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) and oxybenzone, usually found in chemical sunscreens,</span>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">absorb UV rays. Both will work to protect your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SPF stands for \u201csun protection factor\u201d and it measures the level of protection against UVB rays, or the rays responsible for sunburn. According to dermatologist and member of the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_502210.htm\">MDSolarSciences</a> Scientific Advisory Council, Dr. Diane Berson, an SPF 15 covers 93 percent of UVB rays, SPF 30 covers 97 percent, SPF 50 covers 98 percent. Sunscreen brands use independent testing companies to test the SPF levels in their products in compliance with the FDA testing guidelines.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cBefore the FDA introduced its new labeling requirements a few years ago, SPF levels caused a lot of confusion for customers,\u201d explains Dr. Berson. \u201cSome people thought that the SPF number corresponded to the number of minutes the sunscreen protected the skin, the percentage of rays the sunscreen filtered or other misguided logic. The SPF number theoretically correlates to how long a person can stay in the sun without burning. For example, when wearing an SPF 30, you can remain outside for 30 times longer than if you were unprotected. However, that doesn\u2019t take into consideration your skin type, any toweling, swimming, sweating or the level of the UV index that particular day.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind that the SPF of a sunscreen product does not cover UVA rays, or the rays responsible for premature skin aging. To protect your skin from both UVA and UVB rays, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-tips-when-buying-sunscreen/\">choose a sunscreen</a> that says \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d on the label. \u201cWhen choosing a sunscreen, make sure that you\u2019re choosing a product that has been tested for broad-spectrum protection (protects from both UVA and UVB). That way, you\u2019ll be protected not only from the immediate effects of sun damage (sunburn) but also from long-term damage that shows up as wrinkles, sunspots and worse\u2014skin cancer,\u201d Dr. Berson says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fun fact if you think you must use a (super-dangerous!) tanning oil to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-apply-self-tanner/\">get that sun-kissed glow</a>: Dr. Lamb says you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get a tan from using sunscreen. The only catch is that it will be at a much slower rate than if you weren\u2019t wearing sunscreen. How can you still get those freckles and tan lines even if you\u2019re reapplying? Dr. Lamb explains that there is no sure-fire formula that can protect against 100 percent of UV rays. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Berson, while there is a fairly big difference between an SPF 15 and 30, the difference in coverage lessens considerably between SPF 30 and SPF 50. Protection afforded by <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-spf-50/\">products over SPF 50</a> is only incremental. \u201cSince an SPF 50 protects from 98% of UVB rays and nothing offers 100% protection, there is no statistical significance to using an SPF over 50. Products with higher SPF values may be misleading and give consumers a false sense of security,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhen customers see a product marketed as an SPF 100+, some may think that means they\u2019re protected from 100% of the UVB rays, or that the product will work all day. There\u2019s no such thing as a total sunblock\u2014and all products must be reapplied in accordance with the FDA guidelines.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though many factors might contribute to how long sunscreen protection lasts\u2014from the level of UV index to whether you\u2019re sweating or swimming\u2014as a general rule of thumb, experts recommend reapplying your sunscreen every two hours.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWith the new FDA regulations, it\u2019s much easier for people to understand the need to reapply at least every two hours, and every 40 or 80 minutes while swimming or sweating. These directions are now easily seen on the packaging,\u201d says Dr. Berson.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heading to the pool with your little guy but not sure how to protect his virgin skin? Dr. Lamb says it\u2019s not recommended for newborns to wear sunscreen until they\u2019re at least six months old. However, if you\u2019re spending time strolling around under the hottest time of day, she suggests layering on hats, sunglasses and clothing. Once they\u2019re old enough, consider <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-baby-sunscreens/\">sunscreens specifically designed for babies</a> and to reapply sunscreen more often just to be safe. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While everyone has a varying preference on using traditional sunscreen options versus the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/natural-sunscreen-alternatives/\">more natural alternatives</a>, there are certain words on the back of that label you should search for before when heading to check out. What are they? According to Dr. Lamb, \u201cparabens\u201d and \u201cformaldehydes\u201d can be problematic to sensitive skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunscreen does not fully block vitamin D but it may <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-get-vitamin-d-sans-the-sun/\">lower absorption of vitamin D</a>, according to\u00a0dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.socodermatology.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Robin Evans, MD</a>. If you\u2019re concerned about a deficiency, she suggests taking a blood test that will quickly tell you if your levels are low. If they are, she suggests taking a supplement, rather than exposing yourself to dangerous rays. \u201cWe know that sun exposure is linked to skin cancer; better to take vitamin D as a supplement and then limit one\u2019s sun exposure to decrease your risk for skin cancer,\u201d she notes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like most beauty products, sunscreen also has an expiration date for when they should be used or thrown out, so check the bottle to determine if and when you need to replenish. As skin care products tend to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/expired-beauty-products/\">deteriorate once opened</a>, remember to replace your used sunscreen two years after it\u2019s been opened\u2014even if the expiration date on its label says otherwise\u2014to make sure you\u2019re getting the utmost protection. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While expired sunscreen won\u2019t damage your skin, you should use sunscreen before it expires for the best results and ultimate protection,\u201d Dr. Lamb recommends.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s the kicker: both spray and lotion work perfectly fine, but <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/where-to-apply-sunscreen/\">only if they\u2019re applied appropriately</a>. So if you\u2019re haphazardly pulling a spray bottle out of your beach bag and lazily spritzing it across your body, you\u2019re likely not getting the same protection that you receive when you massage your lotion vigorously until it\u2019s completely rubbed in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From her professional standpoint, Dr. Evans always prefers a lotion over a spray: \u201cCreams and lotions will offer better protection than sprays. A spray, of course, is better than nothing, but these formulations offer inferior protection,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re thinking of mixing up your own cocktail of sunscreen to try and budget for an extended beach vacation, Dr. Lamb says to think again. \u201cI do not believe in DIY sunscreen. It is unsafe and impossible to know if you are getting the correct amount of the zinc or titanium dioxide when you make it yourself,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, instead of making beauty products at home, says Dr. Evans, you can protect yourself from the sun using clothing. She also adds that having a healthy amount of antioxidants in your diet will help prevent sun damage, too. Another piece of good news? If you\u2019re not a fan of the traditional gooey cream that leaves a white cast on your skin, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/new-sunscreen-formulas/\">new sunscreen formulas</a>\u2014from powders to sticks to setting sprays\u2014are not only just as effective but are also convenient enough to tote around and reapply wherever, whenever!</p>"},

And the good news for you? They\u2019re willing to share the under-the-radar buys you have to try ASAP:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clinical esthetician </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/glowingskinbyLedia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ledia Sotelo</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may help others discover their best skin through treatments, but for an at-home solution, she suggests this serum that works wonders. Especially if you\u2019re in your late 30s, it\u2019ll give you the TLC boost you need to keep your face flawless and wrinkle-free, thanks to one key ingredient: hyaluronic acid. \u201cThis ingredient occurs naturally in our body to help keep our skin supple and youthful. But unfortunately our levels of hyaluronic acid diminish with aging</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most significantly after the age of 40, when we start to see loss of radiance and volume. This serum will give you that radiant skin you\u00a0once had when you were younger,\u201d she says.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For best results, Sotelo says to apply a pea-size amount in the morning before your SPF and at night after you slather on your go-to retinol. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though your dermatologist recommends using a retinol in the evening and antioxidants in the morning, what happens when your skin reaches a plateau? Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC, Dr. </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/joshzeichnermd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joshua Zeichner, MD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says many people forget about devices designed to add extra benefits to our skin. His go-to is this kit from NuFACE. How does it work? He explains that microcurrents create a low-grade charge across the skin that help firm and tighten laxity. Especially if you\u2019re just starting to use anti-aging products, you\u2019ll see a difference: \u201cIt is best used in people who are just starting to see loss of skin elasticity, when skin cells are still healthy but activity is beginning to decline,\u201d he says. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Dr. Zeichner suggests pulling out this bad boy 20 minutes each day. If you\u2019re not seeing results right away, don\u2019t worry, as he says it usually takes several uses to reap a reward. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s great about this primer isn\u2019t just its on-the-surface benefits, but the multi-purpose deep-action ones, too. As celebrity hair and makeup artist </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/danielkoyeofficial\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Daniel Koye</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> explains, you can use it on its own or mix with your trusted foundation to make a tinted moisturizer. \u201cSummer is around the corner and your foundation may be a bit too thick and you just want to even out your skin tone. This primer will smooth out your skin and give you\u00a0just enough coverage that will make your foundation give you the natural glow,\u201d he explains.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: He suggests starting applying one pump of this primer to your face and using your foundation brush or beauty blender to mix for the most natural-looking finish. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When hairstylist and makeup artist </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/sophiaportermakeup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophia Porter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> needs an oil, she only has eyes for this one. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I use it as a moisturizer after applying serum, add it to cream foundation to create a dewy finish and use it on top of makeup for a natural sheen on the high points of the face,\u201d she explains. Why does she like it? It\u2019s versatile, quality ingredients can combat dryness and lock in hydration</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">making it appropriate for combination-to-dry skin, all year round. She even applies it to dry patches during the coldest days of winter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: After washing your face with a trusted cleanser and applying a toner and serum, it\u2019s time for the oil. Porter says it should be the last step before you apply your makeup, ensuring your skin is super-moisturized and ready for the day. If you want to go light-handed with the oil, she says to use it as a highlighter by applying it the high points of your face for an added shine. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all your must-have beauty products, sunscreen is the most vital one for ensuring your skin\u2019s health and youth. But you don\u2019t have to go liquid to protect your pores, according to makeup artist and hairstylist </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/JulesAnnen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jules Annen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She uses this self-dispensing brush for quick, simple application. Especially if you have on makeup and don\u2019t want to smudge </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your look, this powder version is easier for reapplication. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cLightweight and water-resistant, it\u2019s free of fragrance, dyes, talc and other common irritants, and is perfect for sensitive skin types,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe micronized minerals reduce inflammation and redness, protecting and correcting your complexion while the titanium dioxide and zinc oxide provide physical sun protection.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Apply before your makeup, and then reapply every two to three hours, depending on how much exposure you have to the sun, Annen suggests.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem: you want to look sun-kissed, but your PTO doesn\u2019t allow for a getaway. Solution: </span><a href=\"http://instagram.com/jamisvay\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">makeup artist Jami Svay\u2019s</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> secret product to fake a beach vacation. \u201cI love RMS Living Luminizer because it gives your skin a natural glow, as if you just left Bali! Most highlighters can appear too glittery or chalky. Living Luminizer allows your skin to really beam,\u201d she explains. Since most people are on the lifelong quest to have fresh, healthy-looking skin, this luminizer does the hard work for you, without adding another layer of makeup to your skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Svay says to warm up the product between your fingers so it glides on with ease. Then, apply it to where the light hits your face</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your cheekbones, the bridge of your nose and the bow of your lip. To finish, pat into the skin until blended. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve tried the liquid, the wipes and the foam, but nothing will take away last night\u2019s cat eye, don\u2019t give up just yet.

What will surprise you about this little slice of magic is that it only requires water\u2014not even solution\u2014to get rid of your day\u2019s makeup. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How to use it</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Ferdous says to run your Makeup Eraser under warm water, wring it out, and then firmly make circular motions around your face. Within a few minutes, your skin will be back to its natural state.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your life is overbooked, you need products that can work double (or triple) time to get you out the door and pushing through your to-do list faster.

Then</span> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-double-cleansing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">double cleansing</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> came along, and our bedtime routines were never the same again. Turns out our usual soap-and-water combo (and face wipes) isn\u2019t going to cut it if we want all that gunk and grime off our face after a full day at work (and extended happy hour).</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDouble cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: First, with an oil-based cleanser and again with a water-based cleanser. It can help remove stubborn, pore-clogging and acne-causing impurities that can remain on the skin even after washing your face once,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist</span> <a href=\"https://curology.com/medical-team\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">David Lortscher, M.D.</span></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe benefit of double cleansing is that the first cleanser will break down any makeup, remove dirt and excess oils from the day and clean your skin. The second cleanser will address your particular skin type or concern and should have ingredients to hydrate, smooth or exfoliate and treat acne. Doing both steps will assure that any treatment and moisturizing is not done in vain,\u201d adds New York\u2013based dermatologist Craig Austin, founder of</span> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cane+and+Austin_501890.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cane+Austin</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Double cleansing may be a two-step technique that only adds a few minutes to your usual regimen, but as with most things in skin care, it\u2019s not a one-routine-fits-all. Considering every skin type and taking into account your specific skin concerns, choosing the right double-cleansing duo is key in making sure you get the most out of your routine.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the best double-cleansing products for your skin type also allows you to avoid over-washing and over-drying your skin. \u201cIf we strip too much of our natural oils, our body can respond by producing more oil that can lead to breakouts and irritation,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist</span> <a href=\"https://www.ctdermgroup.com/robinson\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deanne Robinson, M.D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.tracyevansmd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tracy Evans, M.D.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a California-based, board-certified dermatologist, echoes this and suggests double cleansing only at night\u2014when you actually have dirt and makeup to wash off\u2014to make sure you\u2019re not altering the natural balance of oils and microbes on your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With all the products on store shelves and beauty aisles, picking out your double-cleansing dream team </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be overwhelming\u2014especially if you\u2019re not sure what ingredients to look for or which cleanser is best for your skin type. So don\u2019t just grab the first face wash and cleansing oil that you see. First, read the tips below to know which dynamic cleansing duo will give your skin that much-needed deep-cleaning glow!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lathering your face with more oil when you\u2019re already battling with slick and shine sounds like a recipe for (a greasy) disaster, but an\u00a0</span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-use-cleansing-oil/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oil-based cleanser can actually help rid your skin of impurities and sebum</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cOil attracts oil, so this will help to remove makeup, sweat and any other oil that has accumulated on your skin,\u201d explains Dr. Lortscher. If you\u2019re not a fan of oils, soak a cotton pad in micellar water instead and lightly dab and sweep over your eyes and across your face. Its tiny oil molecules called micelles can effectively draw out pore-clogging dirt and excess oil.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cleanser 2:\u00a0</strong>Try\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Bioglycolic+Oily+Skin+Cleansing+Gel_2534.htm\">Jan Marini Bioglycolic Oily Skin Cleansing Gel</a> or\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_CERAMIC+SLIP+Clay+Cleanser_40132.htm\">Sunday Riley CERAMIC SLIP Clay Cleanser</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Follow it up with a gel or clay face cleanser, suggests Dr. Austin, with ingredients like aloe, rose, green tea, moringa seed and glycolic acid.

At first glance, double cleansing may seem counterproductive and a chance to only up the chances of irritation. Not to mention, certain oils can be comedogenic and aggravate acne-prone skin. But as we all know, cleansing is the cornerstone of healthy skin, so for sensitive-skin types, reach for a gentle cleansing oil when removing your makeup.

While we are definitely grateful for the wisdom that age and experience afford us, it\u2019s hard to nurture the same appreciation for the <em>other </em>things that come with the passing years: \u00a0wrinkles, age spots and dull and sagging skin. Still, the changes in your skin is all part of the natural aging process. But while laugh lines and crow\u2019s feet are inevitable, you <em>can </em>slow the process down and continue on with your quest to age gracefully. How? By arming yourself with a skin care regimen fitted with products that address the unique needs and concerns of mature skin\u2014starting with the most important step in your routine: cleansing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As you grow older, your skin goes through <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/004014.htm\">a number of changes</a>. All of a sudden, the products you swore by in your 20s are no longer as effective as you remembered them to be. You may also find that your skin has started to develop certain problems that you\u2019ve never had in the past\u2014like dryness or adult acne. This is because the building blocks of healthy skin\u2014the proteins collagen and elastin\u2014start to break down as you age, resulting in dullness, loss of firmness and fine lines and creases.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shedding dead skin cells also doesn\u2019t occur as often or as quickly when you have mature skin, and this often causes your skin to look rough and lifeless. The loss of key proteins also leads to the thinning of your dermal layers, making it more prone to tearing and bruising.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Menopause also plays a role. Not only does this joyful time (we\u2019re kidding\u2014menopause is anything but) open up a world of hot flashes, mood swings and slower metabolism, the rapid decline in hormones also <a href=\"https://www.aad.org/public/skin-hair-nails/skin-care/skin-care-during-menopause\">takes a toll on your skin</a>, often leading to breakouts, dryness and even facial hair. And if you\u2019ve been taking sun protection for granted, you\u2019ll find that the effects of UV damage become more pronounced as you mature.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMore concerning than the decreased collagen and elastin production is the fact that chronic sun damage throughout our life has a cumulative effect of destroying the collagen and elastin that make up the connective tissue of our skin,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://juvetress.com/\">Hal Weitzbuch, MD, MS, FAAD</a>. \u201cOlder patients, especially those who haven\u2019t protected [their skin] from ultraviolet radiation well, usually have very thin skin on sun-exposed areas and frequently complain of how easily they bruise,\u201d he adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s important to recognize and address the changing needs of mature skin, says beauty chemist and skin care expert <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\">David Pollock</a>. \u201cThe increasing signs of aging\u2014including wrinkles, larger pores and the appearance of age spots\u2014create different skin care needs,\u201d he says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When fine-tuning your skin care regimen, making cleansing a priority is key. After all, your anti-aging moisturizers and serums can only do the job they promise if they have a clean canvas to penetrate and seep into. Further, it\u2019s important to pick a cleanser that not only rids your skin of debris and other surface impurities but also contains ingredients\u2014such as vitamins, antioxidants and retinoids\u2014that help address the common concerns of mature skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But don\u2019t over-cleanse and hoard all the anti-aging cleansers you can get your hands on, either, says Dr. Weitzbuch. \u201cIn general, our face should be cleansed twice daily, our hands as often as needed and our bodies daily. It\u2019s important to remember that very strong and irritating cleansers used too often can hurt the skin. Simpler and softer is usually the best,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to cleanse your way to more radiant and youthful-looking skin? We\u2019re here to help! To get you started, here are our top picks for the best face cleanser for the most common concerns of mature skin!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider yourself lucky if you have normal skin. Not only does this allow you to experiment more freely, you\u2019re also less likely to need to use multiple products and treatments at once. \u201cThose with normal skin don\u2019t need a flashy skin care routine,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://livadskincare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Janet Prystowsky, MD, PhD</a>. \u201cConsistency is the key. Once more products are added to the routine, there is more room for error.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing your cleanser, New York-based cosmetic dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.michelegreenmd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michele Green, MD</a>, recommends looking out for ingredients such as panthenol or provitamin B5 and glycolic acid to provide your skin with moisture while gently washing away impurities. She also adds, \u201cIf you have normal skin, you want to avoid ingredients such as mineral oil, lauryl sulfate and alcohol.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For sensitive skin types, steer clear of products with fragrance, says Dr. Prystowsky, as these are \u201clikely to cause allergies for people with sensitive skin.\u201d You\u2019ll also want to avoid abrasive scrubs, alcohol, and certain essential oils, adds Dr. Green. Instead, she suggests going for \u201cnon-irritating ingredients such as oatmeal, shea butter, and panthenol.\u201d Aside from delivering much-needed moisture, these ingredients also help in repairing damaged skin and relieving irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Perhaps thanks to the ever-growing influence of celebrities and social media, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-to-know-before-cosmetic-surgery/\">minimally invasive cosmetic procedures</a> have enjoyed a steady rise in recent years. But just as it\u2019s important to carefully think about what procedure you\u2019d like to undergo, it\u2019s also crucial to consider the after-care that your skin will need. \u201cYour healthcare provider should be able to pair a great post-procedure product with the specific procedure, depending on how aggressive it is. Avoid harsh acids,\u201d says Dr. Weitzbuch.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Green, \u201cProducts containing ceramides and hyaluronic acid are great post-procedure. These help the skin maintain its moisture level, leaving the skin hydrated and allowing it to heal.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While your skin may have been spared from the nightmare of teen acne, there\u2019s a chance that you may begin to experience breakouts as you age\u2014especially as you go through menopause. To prevent adult acne, Dr. Green says, \u201cIf you\u2019re prone to acne, avoid products containing oils and alcohol as these can clog your pores and increase sebum production.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, keep an eye out for AHAs and vitamin A, says Dr. Prystowsky. \u201cThese ingredients can help relieve breakouts and reduce your skin\u2019s fragility,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Loss of firmness and elasticity rank high in the list of skin concerns for mature skin, and unfortunately, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any magic creams out there that completely reverse sagging skin,\u201d says Dr. Weitzbuch. But not to worry\u2014all is not lost! According to Dr. Green, retinols and vitamins C and E are great for sagging skin as these ingredients can help encourage the production of collagen while protecting your skin from free radical damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sun protection is a must at any age, but if you\u2019ve been neglecting your daily SPF for years, then hyperpigmentation is likely going to be a top concern for your skin. To help minimize the appearance of these dark spots, look for lightening ingredients like hydroquinone, kojic acid, niacinamide and exfoliating acids (salicylic, glycolic, and azelaic acids, to name a few). Most importantly, don\u2019t step out of the house without applying broad-spectrum sunscreen. Look for mineral UV blockers like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide to minimize the risk of irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The buildup of dead skin cells on your outer dermal layer is one of the primary causes of dull skin, says Dr. Weitzbuch, so he recommends cleansing with a face wash that contains glycolic acid. As an exfoliant, glycolic acid dissolves the substance that binds dead skin cells to the surface, allowing your skin to renew itself and leaving it with a healthier glow. Antioxidants like vitamins A, C and E can also brighten dull and tired-looking skin, says Dr. Green.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your skin tends to be on the parched side, then it\u2019s more prone to developing early signs of aging. When picking out a cleanser, make sure you skip face washes with ingredients that can strip your skin of its natural oils. \u201cAvoid soap and harsh cleansers with sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate,\u201d says Dr. Prystowsky. Instead, choose a rich and creamy formula infused with moisture-boosting ingredients like aloe vera, hydrating oils and dimethicone.</p>"},

It just goes to show that no one is impervious to skin issues, which can strike anyone regardless of age, profession, financial status or whether or not one has a glam squad at her beck and call.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news? Healthy skin,\u00a0according to Darden, is not only possible but also achievable even with a few strategic skin care products and a simple, but consistent, regimen. And she knows this for a fact based on her own personal experience. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I had a lot of skin care problems,\u201d shares Darden. \u201cI remember the insecurity of that well, and it really made me want to help people to feel good about themselves.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of her personal struggles, she made it her mission to help people transform their skin. She did this by launching a career as a licensed esthetician, working alongside distinguished dermatologist Dr. Erma Benitez, from whom she gained extensive knowledge on treating acne and other extreme skin conditions. After that, she took her expertise to\u00a0luxurious spas and reputable clinics around Los Angeles\u2014Le Spa by Sofitel and Kinara Skin Care Clinic, among others\u2014where she earned a loyal following and made a name for herself as one of the most sought-after estheticians among Hollywood A-listers and runway models.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to know what a celebrity esthetician\u2019s skin care regimen looks like and what products she actually uses? So do we. Here we carved a few minutes out of her busy life to ask her that, as well as tips on how to battle our biggest skin care issues and beauty boo-boos.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>SD:</strong> My philosophy has been \u201cless is more\u201d for years. I see so many people just piling on products, and not only does it reduce the efficacy of products, it can cause issues like chemical burns if you\u2019re layering too many active products. I really like to keep things simple!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sun exposure is responsible for all of the skin issues that you see later on. Sun damage takes literal decades to come to the surface, so when you\u2019re in the sun a lot when you\u2019re younger, you won\u2019t start to see the damage come through until your early 30s. I wear sunscreen every single day, and keep my face covered with sunglasses and a hat with a wide brim. In general, I just try to stay out of the sun as much as possible!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the biggest mistakes I see people making is not using the right products for their skin type. Just because a product is trendy or someone else uses it and has great results, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work great for you. This is why it\u2019s also so important to introduce new products into your routine slowly. You\u2019re able to better isolate any issues that new products may be causing this way.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">People used to think that over-drying your skin when you have acne was the best way to treat it. However, the reality is that it just makes you break out more. It\u2019s best to make sure you\u2019re cleansing your skin thoroughly with a gentle cleanser, exfoliating one to two times a week to remove the dead skin cells from the surface, and using a targeted acne serum. My Texture Reform\u2122 Gentle Resurfacing Serum will also help with acne too!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Gentle cleanser<br>\n2. Vitamin C serum for the daytime<br>\n3. Sunscreen<br>\n4. Retinol serum if your skin can tolerate it<br>\n5. A great moisturizer for your skin type</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I try to find products that are effective but not harsh, products that won\u2019t cause congestion and overall products that have good, active ingredients! I think it\u2019s worth it to splurge on products with great, active ingredients. You\u2019re going to get the most benefit out of these products!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is my favorite gel cleanser. It is effective at thoroughly cleansing your skin, but does so gently and without stripping your skin, which is so important.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I love a vitamin C serum in the morning before SPF so that you\u2019re getting antioxidant protection throughout the day. It will help to reverse sun damage by boosting collagen in the skin, as well as being an amazing skin brightener.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These peels are an amazing chemical exfoliant that combine both alpha and beta hydroxy acids to remove the dead skin cells from the surface and keep your pores clear. You can use these one to two times a week depending on your skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This oil-free sunscreen has an SPF 50 for great protection. The oil-free formula is still hydrating, though, so it can double as your daily\u00a0moisturizer!</p>"},

That said, external aggressors like air pollution and acne-causing bacteria aren\u2019t the only things that get in the way of healthy-looking skin\u2014hormones can too. \u201cHormones are biochemical messengers that have many jobs including playing a role in cardiovascular health, bone growth and blood sugar regulation,\u201d says <u><a href=\"https://www.nmdwellnessofscottsdale.com/\">Dr. Alissia Zenhausern, NMD</a></u>. \u201cWhen hormones are off balance, they can lead to the development of symptoms both in your body as well as on your skin,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Breaking out or experiencing excess oil production while on your period is a great example of how hormones can impact the skin. However, sex hormones aren\u2019t the only types of hormones that can wreak havoc on the complexion. \u201cWhen it comes to thyroid dysfunction, an overactive thyroid\u2014known as hyperthyroidism\u2014can cause symptoms including warm, sweaty, flushed skin,\u201d says Dr. Zenhausern. \u201cAn underactive thyroid\u2014hypothyroidism\u2014can lead to symptoms including dry, coarse skin that actually have difficulty sweating,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Zenhausern, some of the most common skin symptoms and signs associated with thyroid conditions such as hypothyroidism are \u201cdry itchy skin, itchy flaking of the scalp, dry cracked heels [and] paleness of the skin.\u201d In addition, Dr. Zenhausern says it\u2019s not uncommon to experience dry, frizzy hair, thinning of the hair and loss of eyelashes. She also says loss of the outer-third of the eyebrows \u201cis a huge sign that you should get your thyroid levels checked.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As far as when to see a doctor goes, Dr. Zenhausern suggests annual routine visits \u201cas thyroid conditions can often be caught before severe symptoms occur.\u201d That said, if you notice any of the above symptoms, consider scheduling an appointment to have your thyroid tested. \u201cYour doctor will complete a physical exam to evaluate your thyroid,\u201d says Dr. Zenhausern. In addition to completing a physical exam, a doctor \u201cwill also evaluate your thyroid hormones with a simple blood test known as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). This hormone comes from your pituitary gland and signals your thyroid to produce hormones,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to testing the thyroid-stimulating hormone, Dr. Zenhausern also stresses the importance of the T3 and T4 hormones as well as antibodies. \u201cAntibodies will be present in autoimmune conditions of thyroid disorders. What this means is that antibodies (your own immune cells that should normally be fighting foreign invaders) are fighting your own body\u2014in this case, your own thyroid,\u201d she explains. \u201cTSH, T4, T3 and thyroid antibodies can all be evaluated in the same blood draw, so make sure to ask your doctor for the comprehensive thyroid blood workup,\u201d she concludes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThyroid conditions are broken down into two main categories,\u201d says Dr. Zenhausern. \u201cHyperthyroid means your thyroid is producing too much thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). \u201cHypothyroid means your thyroid is somewhat lazy and is unable to produce enough thyroid hormones,\u201d she explains. Some of the most common symptoms for hyperthyroid include:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the contrary, the most common symptoms for hypothyroid include:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to finding a remedy for skin issues caused by an overactive or underactive thyroid, Dr. Zenhausern says it\u2019s important to focus on the root cause. \u201cYour symptoms will continue until your thyroid hormones have been treated,\u201d she explains. \u201cTreating only the skin symptoms [is like] a temporary Band-Aid on a chronic problem. This is why your [doctor] will often ask you other non-skin-related questions to evaluate your thyroid,\u201d she adds. Dr. Zenhausern says to be prepared to answer questions about fatigue, sensitivity to cold or hot, recent weight gain or weight loss, bulging of the eyes, memory problems, diarrhea or constipation, and irregular menstrual cycles, as \u201call of these symptoms can be linked to thyroid disorders.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That said, once your thyroid-related skin symptoms are monitored by a doctor, there are a few things you can do to help promote a healthier-looking complexion. \u201cMake sure to keep your skin well hydrated by using natural hydrating topical treatments,\u201d Dr. Zenhausern advises. \u201cAs your thyroid hormones begin to become balanced, your skin symptoms will resolve,\u201d she adds. Because your skin symptoms can be a way to draw attention to an underlying issue\u2014such as hypothyroidism\u2014trying to get rid of certain symptoms can be near impossible without the help of a doctor.</p>"},
{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/j-beauty-vs-k-beauty/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">J-Beauty vs. K-Beauty: What\u2019s the Difference?</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Janeca Racho \u00b7 August 2, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Judging by the number of its recent converts and passionate admirers, it\u2019s safe to say that Asian beauty and skin care is not just a trendy, of-the-moment craze that eventually gets pushed aside as its viral status fizzles out. In fact, we have seen Korean beauty or K-beauty take the spotlight in the last couple of years. But that\u2019s not all. In recent months, its Japanese counterpart, or J-beauty, has likewise landed itself on the radar of beauty and skin care connoisseurs. Now, we\u2019re not here to join in on the great K-beauty versus J-beauty debate of 2018. Besides, why choose between the two when we can definitely benefit from incorporating both beauty philosophies into our own skin care routines?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before discussing what makes each of these beauty cultures distinct, it\u2019s important to point out that while K-beauty and J-beauty have different approaches to skin care, they share the same goal and attitude when it comes to skin health. \u201cBoth K- and J-beauty focus on hydration as well as reduction or prevention of pigmentation (brown spots and melasma). They both involve sun avoidance and protective barriers against sun exposure,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist Anna Guanche, founder and director of <a href=\"http://www.bellaskininstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bella Skin Institute</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While both put great emphasis on cleansing (Japanese women even introduced us to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-double-cleansing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">double-cleansing</a>), hydration and potent formulas made with the highest-quality ingredients\u2014K-beauty and J-beauty\u2014often differ in their methods. \u201cJapanese skin care is more reserved. While considered innovative and science-driven, J-beauty is more about functionality and simplicity with long-term results,\u201d says skin care expert and beauty chemist David Pollock, founder of <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JustAskDavid.com</a>. Japanese beauty draws from their culture\u2019s rich heritage and centuries-old traditions, evidenced by their uncompromising commitment to harnessing highly effective indigenous ingredients, simple yet proven formulations and minimalist, no-frills regimens. Japanese beauty also relies heavily on scientific research and innovations, ensuring product quality and long-lasting benefits. \u201cI would say that J-beauty demonstrates a philosophy of practicing a skin care marathon rather than a sprint,\u201d Pollock adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, K-beauty is centered on skin care advancements. It may have set social media abuzz with its flat lay-ready packaging and cemented our love for sheet masks, but K-beauty is more about mastering the science of skin care and leading the way in discovering new ingredients, textures and formulations. This is clearly seen in the type of products they have introduced to the rest of the world, which have created categories that are all their own. And whereas Japanese women tend to keep their skin care routines as straightforward as possible, Korean beauty leaves a lot of room for layering and experimentation. \u201cKorean women use a lengthy list of products. They tend to optimize dewy, glowy, fresh-looking skin,\u201d adds Dr. Guanche.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Korean beauty is perhaps best-known for its <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/korean-beauty-editor-on-10-step-skin-care/\">10-step regimen</a>\u2014which, when taken to the extreme, can actually be as many as 15 (or reduced to five, if you prefer to keep things simple)\u2014that promises to give you that coveted \u201cglass skin.\u201d And with each step, hydration remains the focus. \u201cWhile all of us consider it important to cleanse, layer a targeted serum and follow that with a moisturizer and eye cream, K-beauty takes the process further with additional steps,\u201d explains Pollock. These steps typically involve a range of products that are uniquely Korean\u2014from their textures and consistencies to gram-worthy wrappings and jars. Not to mention, ingredients that are derived from the most unexpected of sources. \u201cKorean key ingredients can sometimes seem bizarre, but they work! Serums can actually be made of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/i-applied-snail-serum-to-my-face/\">snail mucin</a>! Other ingredients include <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hydrating hyaluronic acid</a>, bee-derived propolis, ginseng, arbutin, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-care-benefits-honey/\">honey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a> and tea tree oil,\u201d adds Dr. Guanche. Here are some of the products that form the foundation of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/korean-skin-care-routine/\">every K-beauty routine</a>:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On the other hand, Japanese women put more emphasis on simplifying their beauty regimen with products that deliver more than one intended benefit and \u201coffering more preventative care and long-term benefits,\u201d explains Pollock. Their nightly double-cleansing routine is a prime example: Not only does it thoroughly cleanse to prevent clogged pores and breakouts, it also <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-double-cleanse/\">addresses skin concerns</a> like dryness. \u201cJapanese women cleanse their skin so well at night that they are able to cleanse with just water in the morning. They also like to exfoliate but not with any harsh scrubs. In addition, they love to massage their face with their own hands for a lymphatic massage or use expensive facial rollers to stimulate repair,\u201d adds Dr. Guanche. Japanese beauty also favors lighter textures\u2014such as milks, gels and emulsions\u2014so as not to weigh down the skin after layering. \u201cThey focus on a more matte, softer, almost velvet-like skin. They like applying light layers of few products,\u201d adds Dr. Guanche. A typical Japanese skin care routine involves:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starting your own K-beauty or J-beauty regimen may seem like hard work, especially since both routines involve introducing new products to your existing routine. But the good news is, applying these beauty philosophies don\u2019t actually require you to overhaul your entire daily regimen. \u201cI would suggest starting with a simple sheet mask to amp up your beauty regimen. There are many available and you can choose one that focuses on your problem areas such as dryness, redness, dull skin or texture. Once you learn to incorporate a sheet mask into your regimen, you could then try adding another step in the daytime,\u201d suggests Dr. Guanche.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If ampoules, essences and lotions still sound intimidating to you, you can start with a hydrating serum instead, says Dr. Guanche. \u201cSince J-Beauty and K-Beauty focus on hydration, adding more hydrating products help your skin look and feel more refreshed. Don\u2019t forget to gently massage your skin to stimulate blood flow!\u201d she adds. Ultimately, Pollock says, starting your own regimen depends on what suits you and your skin the most. After all, there\u2019s no rule that says you can\u2019t reap the benefits of both.</p>"},

In essence, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-are-retinoids/\">retinol is a form of vitamin A</a>,\u00a0a nutrient we glean from food in our diet, as well as supplements, that is crucial for eyesight as well as maintenance of the skin. As a skin care ingredient, retinol works to neutralize free radicals, stimulate collagen production and accelerate skin turnover, smoothing fine lines and wrinkles and blurring acne marks and other blemishes in the process. You\u2019ll find retinol as a star ingredient in many anti-aging serums and creams in lower concentrations (starting at .01%), while\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">prescription-strength retinoid\u00a0creams and serums</a>\u00a0will have at least .5 to 1%.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Given retinol\u2019s impressive skin-boosting benefits, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a dermatologist who is not a proponent. To help you understand retinol and how best to use it, we asked top dermatologists to dig deeper into how to choose the right retinol for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you\u2019re about to hit that big 4-0, consider yourself welcome to the retinoid family. \u201cIn your 40s, previous sun exposure leads to collagen damage, which weakens the skin\u2019s foundation,\u201d says dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Joshua Zeichner, M.D.</a> \u201cMake sure that you are using a topical retinoid in the evening to help stimulate collagen, strengthen the skin and minimize the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because this product can cause your skin to dry out and sometimes turn red, it\u2019s best to talk to your dermatologist before starting a retinoid regimen. Most dermatologists advise to start with over-the-counter retinol products\u00a0with the lowest concentration\u00a0first and see how your skin reacts before moving to higher concentrations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As effective as retinol is when it comes to reversing damage, application plays a big part, because applying too much or too often can have the opposite effect and actually cause more damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s how to incorporate retinol into your skin care routine:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Zeichner reiterates using only a pea-size amount, and to start by applying it to your entire face every other night. Remember that it takes several weeks for your skin to adjust to the product, so it\u2019s best to use it sparingly at first and then gradually increase your use as time goes on. If your skin becomes dry or irritated, Dr. Zeichner suggests holding back to every other night or even once per week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Essentially, over-the-counter concentrations are weaker and deemed safe by the FDA to be used without the supervision of a medical professional, explains Dendy Engelman, M.D., a dermatologist at <u><a href=\"https://www.mdcsnyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Manhattan Dermatology and Cosmetic Surgery</a></u> in New York City. There is, however, a \u201cretinoid reaction,\u201d which causes skin peeling and redness for around two to six weeks or so after application. For most people, this is just an adjustment period, and this irritation goes away. \u201cThis process is one of exfoliation, and during that first phase there is a thinner stratum corneum (top layer of epidermis), but what happens over time is that the dermis (deeper layer) becomes thicker and more robust with less lines (wrinkles live in the dermis),\u201d according to Anna Guanche, MD, dermatologist and founder of the <u><a href=\"http://www.bellaskininstitute.com/\">Bella Skin Institute</a></u>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinol can be combined with other products to encourage cell rejuvenation, revitalizing the topical skin layer while improving collagen production, like alpha and beta hydroxy acids.\u00a0A 2015 study suggests that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4633208/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids produce a synergistic effect</a>\u00a0when used together.\u00a0Subjects cleansed with AHAs and then applied\u00a0a retinol-based anti-aging serum twice a day (in addition to SPF 50+), which proved to be safe and effective for\u00a0skin with moderate-to-severe photo damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, if your skin is sensitive, it\u2019s best not to combine it with other potentially irritating ingredients, such as vitamin C or alpha or beta hydroxy acids. The best thing you can use in conjunction with retinol, according to Dr. Zeichner, is a moisturizer, which can help hydrate and prime the skin and reduce the risk of irritation from retinol. \u201cSome people even prefer to mix their retinol with a moisturizing cream to dilute it out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you find that your over-the-counter product is not working as well as it used to or if you are reaching a plateau, then it may be time to consider a prescription option.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to keep using your vitamin C with your retinol cream, Beverly Hills dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"https://jasonemermd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jason Emer, MD</a>\u00a0suggests using your vitamin C serum during the day and your retinol at night.\u00a0\u201cI prefer to use my vitamin C during the day to fight free radical damage and my retinol, peptides and growth factors at night,\u201d he says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Zeichner says to expect redness, drying, flaking and burning or stinging of the skin especially in the first few weeks. If this happens, he suggests spacing out applications to use it less frequently. \u201cIt takes time for your skin to adjust,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt also can make you more sensitive to the sun so make sure to wear a daily sunscreen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with any other skin care product, the key to seeing results is consistent use. \u201cRetinol will not deliver visible results quickly, so patience is essential,\u201d says Shereene Idriss, M.D., cosmetic dermatologist at Union Square Laser Dermatology and clinical instructor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cImprovements in textural changes take about two to four months to start to become visible.\u201d With continued use, you\u2019ll see more and more positive changes.</p>"},

Yet, despite being one of the most common beauty woes, it doesn\u2019t make dealing with congestion any better. The good news is that there are a handful of ways to rid the skin of congestion. Some of which involve at-home facials using face masks that detox, purify and promote a more clear complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Up ahead, we take a closer look at what causes congestion to occur, ingredients that help promote clear skin and the best face masks for clogged pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cClogged pores happen when oil, dirt or dead skin cells start to build up,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, board-certified NYC dermatologist, Assistant Professor of Dermatology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and author of <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Rules-Trade-Secrets-Dermatologist/dp/1250025109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologist</a>.</em>\u00a0\u201cPeople with oily or acne-prone skin produce more oil, which can cause clogged pores,\u201d she explains. \u201cClogged pores can cause blackheads, pimples and [might also] lead to skin irritation,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clogged pores\u2014especially the kinds that turn into pimples\u2014can be frustrating, to say the least. But, knowing what causes pores to get clogged in the first place can help you make a more informed decision on how to get rid of clogged pores and prevent future breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMakeup and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/effects-of-air-pollution-on-skin/\">pollution can irritate the pores</a> of the face,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cMake sure the makeup you use is non-comedogenic [specially formulated to not clog pores],\u201d she adds. She further explains, \u201cto avoid clogging your pores with makeup, try to use products that are oil-free,\u201d and always remember to remove all of your makeup and cleanse thoroughly before going to bed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Physical factors like makeup and pollution aren\u2019t the only factors\u2014breakout-prone skin can be hereditary, too. \u201cThe size of your pores depends primarily on your genes,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman. \u201cIf you have <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/big-pores-on-nose-face/\">larger pores</a>, the dead skin inside them is more likely to make you break out,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite some of the causes of clogged pores, there are a few things you can do to keep your pores clean. In addition to trying a deep-cleaning face mask, Dr. Jaliman says, \u201cExfoliating is crucial since it removes pore-enlarging dead skin cells.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On top of that, she suggests visiting a dermatologist for in-office extractions. \u201cYou can also minimize pore size by getting the pores cleaned out by way of a facial,\u201d she adds. \u201cAlso, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-microdermabrasion/\">microdermabrasion is helpful</a> for the same reason\u2014it gets rid of the dead surface skin,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like many things in beauty, ingredients matter, especially when navigating congestion.

Thanks to its ability to gently draw out impurities and deeply cleanse the complexion, charcoal is one of the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/charcoal-benefits-for-skin/\">most popular skin purgers</a> out there. And there\u2019s not a shortage of it in Peter Thomas Roth\u2019s Irish Moor Mud. Enriched with charcoal, lactic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, Moor mud and volcanic ash, the luxurious mask can help reduce the repercussions of environmental stress, shrink the look of pores, draw out toxins and clarify the complexion for a hard-to-beat glow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want a home face mask that requires little to no effort? Reach for Herbivore Botanicals Blue Clay Detoxifying Treatment Mask. The powder formula is enriched with Cambrian blue clay and rose geranium essential oil that, when mixed with water, can create a DIY-inspired face mask that can not only draw out impurities from the complexion but help reduce the look of redness and inflammation\u2014a common side effect of breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Searching for a detox mask that doubles as an anti-ager? You\u2019ve come to the right place. Caudalie\u2019s Instant Detox Mask is enriched with pink clay and Viniferine\u2014a patented natural ingredient known for its ability to target dark spots\u2014to not only purge your complexion but help absorb toxins and purify skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Purging the skin might sound like it\u2019s uncomfortable, but it\u2019s actually the opposite\u2014especially when Sanitas Skincare is involved. Like many detoxifying face masks, the Tea Tree Mask has a clay base that gently draws out impurities. It\u2019s also enriched with salicylic acid to help lift away dry, dead skin cells\u2014which makes it easier for the clay to work its magic\u2014and tea tree oil to cleanse the skin and leave a soothing sensation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because a mask detoxifies doesn\u2019t mean it has to be made of clay. Case in point: Erno Laszlo\u2019s Detoxifying Hydrogel Mask. Enriched with charcoal\u2014a popular skin-purging ingredient that can draw out impurities\u2014along with alpha hydroxy acids and kiwi extract, the luxury sheet mask gently exfoliates the complexion, improves suppleness and acts like a magnet to draw out pesky dirt and debris.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They don\u2019t call it a \u201ccult-favorite\u201d for nothing.

That being said, sunburns happen\u2014especially if you forget to reapply SPF throughout the day\u2014and can put a damper on your summer fun, to say the least. Fortunately, there are a variety of different ways to nurse a sunburn at home, using things you can already find in your cupboard, pantry and even in your vanity cabinet! To find out the best at-home remedies, we tapped two top New York City dermatologists. Here are their recommendations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps one of the most common ways to soothe a sunburn, aloe vera gel can do more than provide the skin with cooling relief. According to board-certified dermatologist, assistant professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and author of <em>Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologist</em>,\u00a0Dr. Debra Jaliman, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">aloe vera\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties</a> provide sunburned skin with a soothing sensation upon application. Keep a bottle of aloe vera in your beach bag this summer\u2014or, even better: use the gel from the actual plant\u2014and apply when needed. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you experience a sunburn on your face, Park Avenue Plastic Surgeon, Melissa Doft, MD suggests applying <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/\">a facial serum infused with hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid</a>, \u201cto help the skin heal faster.\u201d As the skin\u2019s natural hydrator, hyaluronic acid can help moisturize and plump dried, sunburned skin. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What\u2019s worse than a sunburn? An infected sunburn. To help relieve some of the pain and inflammation from the burn\u2014and prevent it from getting infected\u2014Dr. Jaliman suggests applying white vinegar to the affected areas. \u201cBecause white vinegar is composed of acetic acid, it can help relieve the pain and inflammation, and act as an antiseptic,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another important thing to keep in mind when treating a sunburn at home is <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-balance-your-skins-ph-level/\">your skin\u2019s natural pH level</a>. To help balance the pH of burned skin, Dr. Jaliman suggests making a cold compress composed of baking soda and water and applying to sunburned skin for 15 minutes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to baking soda compresses, Dr. Jaliman also suggests giving green tea compresses a try, as <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-tea/\">they contain polyphenols</a>, \u201cwhich are anti-inflammatory.\u201d To do so, simply steep green tea leaves and soak a clean washcloth in the steeped tea. Allow the compress to cool in the fridge before applying to sunburned skin for 15 minutes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thanks to its lactic acid, Greek yogurt is considered an anti-inflammatory and can be used to soothe and moisturize sunburned skin. \u201cGreek yogurt is strained more times than traditional yogurt [and], as a result, it is thicker and has a higher concentration of probiotics,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cRecent studies have found that topical application of probiotics decreases skin sensitivity and redness,\u201d she adds. To soothe a sunburn at home with Greek yogurt, you can apply plain, organic\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/yogurt-skin-benefits/\">Greek yogurt to the face and body</a> as a mask and rinse after 15 minutes. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not into DIY sunburn remedies and are looking for a topical treatment that can soothe and nourish sunburned skin, Dr. Doft suggests reaching for topical treatments that are formulated with soothing, nourishing and replenishing ingredients, such as aloe vera, hyaluronic acid, cucumber extract, oatmeal and antioxidant-rich vitamins C and E. Need help finding a topical treatment? Consider some of the following: </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Soothe a sunburned complexion with Herbivore Botanicals After Sun Skin Soothing Aloe Mist. Enriched with botanical ingredients, such as soothing aloe vera, cooling mint, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/lavender-benefits-for-skin/\">therapeutic lavender</a> and cooling peppermint essential oil, this all-natural sunburn remedy can provide relief to inflamed skin, alleviate redness and provide a calming aroma.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your complexion enjoyed the sun a little </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">too </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">much, consider treating it to a soothing gel facial mask, such as the Cucumber Gel Mask from Peter Thomas Roth. Formulated with aloe vera, the gel mask hydrates the complexion, calms and renews the skin\u2019s appearance and offers relief to sensitive, sunburned skin upon application.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to sunburns, it\u2019s important\u2014read: necessary\u2014to keep the skin moisturized with a creamy body lotion. We love the After-Sun Repair Creamy Gel from Av\u00e8ne, as it provides sunburned skin with a cooling sensation, counteracts the drying effects of the sun and restores the skin\u2019s moisture barrier with nourishing ingredients, such as plant sterols, fatty acids and the brand\u2019s exclusive Thermal Spring Water.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enriched with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a>, vitamin E, aloe vera and green tea, the Organic Aloe Antioxidant Calming Mist from Soleil Toujours works to soothe inflamed\u2014i.e. sunburned\u2014skin, minimize the look of redness\u00a0and provide the complexion with a burst of hydration.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don\u2019t need a DIY remedy to reap the after-sun benefits of Greek yogurt. Korres Greek Yoghurt After-Sun Cooling Gel is enriched with Greek yogurt to provide the skin with immediate relief from excessive sun exposure. Safe to use on the face and body, the cooling gel makes for a great alternative to traditional aloe vera gel as it can cool the skin\u2019s surface and leave a feeling of freshness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to the above ingredients, coconut oil is a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">known skin-nourisher</a> that can soothe dry, post-sun skin. Burt\u2019s Bees Aloe Coconut Oil After Sun Soother combines the nourishing properties of coconut oil with soothing aloe vera and hydrating honey to calm and moisturize the skin. And unlike your tanning oil, this body lotion absorbs quickly into the skin so you can experience soft, well-hydrated skin sans the grease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Looking to relieve sunburned skin, fast? Reach for Hampton Sun\u2019s Hydrating Aloe Continuous Mist Spray. Formulated with nourishing and protecting vitamin E and cooling menthol, this sun care mist is ideal for refreshing and replenishing post-sun skin during the dog days of summer, as it soothes and hydrates the skin, without feeling greasy or oily.</p>"},

You\u2019ve probably tried cleansing, rejuvenating and covering up your skin to minimize or mask the appearance of your pores\u2014but they just won\u2019t shrink. Well, to help minimize your pores, you first need to understand what they are, what purpose they serve and what causes them to appear larger. Here\u2019s a brief overview of pores and some top-rated product recommendations to help you get a flawless complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The word \u201cpore\u201d literally means an opening in a surface\u00a0where microscopic particles can pass. More specific to our bodies, pores are also the opening at the top of our hair follicles. It is also where the sebum (our body\u2019s natural oils) is released to the surface to help our skin be naturally moisturized. Though their appearance can be frustrating, in actuality, when all aspects of our anatomy work in perfect harmony, pores are helpful for maintaining healthy skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Understanding a few details about pores can help you deal with them in a healthy manner and help you avoid potentially harming your skin with unnecessary products. Here are <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_5-Things-to-Know-About-Pores_1980.htm\">five important things to know about pores</a>:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, pores will never permanently shrink\u2014meaning they\u2019re not going to get smaller than they appear in\u00a0their normal, healthy state. This is because pore size is largely dependent on genetics, and pores serve an important function when it comes to healthy skin. You can, however,\u00a0take steps to keep your pores clean and healthy to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Simple-Solutions-for-Minimizing-Large-Pores_1920.htm\">minimize their appearance</a>. Some important tips to consider:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the last point in mind, it\u2019s so important to be strategic about what you\u2019re putting on your face. Below, you\u2019ll find Dermstore\u2019s recommendations for products to clean, shrink or lessen the appearance of your pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Powered by 2% salicylic acid and glycerin, this treatment can help clear, refresh and balance your skin. It\u2019s created by Obagi, which is known for their focus on high-quality, potent ingredients to restore and maintain skin health. One reviewer praised the fast-acting and refreshing effects, saying,\u00a0\u201cLiterally rid me of clogged pores within a week. Best \u2018toner\u2019 I have ever used. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This gel-like cleanser deeply penetrates your skin and dissolves pore-clogging impurities that cause acne and blackheads, thanks to the anti-inflammatory ingredient salicylic acid, which treat\u00a0 acne and calms the skin. It is also infused with panthenol to deeply hydrate your skin and strengthen it while healing superficial scars, leaving you with a smoother complexion. One shopper says, \u201d I have definitely noticed a change in my skin\u2014less cystic acne and noticeably reduced clogged pores!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This potent pore refiner combines chemical\u2014mandelic acid and papain extract\u2014with physical exfoliants\u2014rice powder and pumice\u2014to deeply penetrate the skin and buff away notorious pore cloggers, revealing a visibly brighter skin after the first use. Kaolin and bentonite clay help detoxify skin while absorbing excess sebum to keep acne at bay. The natural antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties of bisabol make this the \u201cpore-fect\u201d exfoliant for those with oily and acne prone skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imagine having a professional microdermabrasion done in the comfort of your own home. This is exactly what the Pore Dermabrasion is all about. Just like the in-office procedure, this exfoliant uses microsize aluminum oxide crystals to slough off surface layers, dulling dead skin cells and excess oil that clog your pores. Add the resurfacing power of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/salicylic-acid-benzoyl-peroxide/\">salicylic acid</a> and you get a smoother, more even-toned complexion.\u00a0 One reviewer can\u2019t help but gush on how, \u201cit leaves the skin feeling soft and fresh and there is a definite glow the next morning.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Berries aren\u2019t just delicious fruits; they have a ton of beneficial properties when it comes to helping the skin. Functioning as both astringents and antioxidants, berries like blueberries and blackberries can help tighten the skin, minimize pores, moisturize and hydrate. This Eminence Organics masque contains not only berries to do all of the above, but honey and a unique natural formula to soothe and strengthen your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many primers are designed just to create a smoother base for applying foundation. This one by Dr. Brandt does that and much more. In addition to helping you achieve\u00a0an ideal texture, the Pores No More Pore Refiner Primer also serves as a pore\u00a0refiner and protecter. Tea tree oil and flaxseed extract help regulate oil and fight bacteria, while the rest of the formula helps prevent your makeup from clogging your pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A cross between makeup and skin care, this lightweight serum blurs out your skins imperfections and smoothes fine lines and wrinkles, leaving you with a smooth, mattified complexion. Dias-pore 20 helps minimize the appearance of larger pores while plankton extracts protect your skin from premature aging. This skin care/primer contains flecks of diamond dust that casts a \u201csoft-focus\u201d luminous effect on your face, highlighting your features while hiding skin imperfections.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tighten your pores and tame your sebaceous glands with the help of salicylic and glycolic acids. These gentle yet potent ingredients help remove the rough skin layers to reveal a smoother skin and help remove impurities that clogs the pores and causes acne. With continued use, this lightweight serum brightens your skin and minimizes the appearance of pores, leaving you with a more radiant complexion. Also works as a primer before makeup.</p>"},

We asked because we never felt the need to worry about the order in which we eat our food. (After all, don\u2019t we absorb the same amount of sugar in sweets even if we eat them last?) So we asked the skin experts the same question we ask ourselves every time we buy a new skin care product or add another step to our routine: In what order should I apply my skin care products and does it matter?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon, Dr. Heather Rogers, applying your skin care products in the proper order ensures that your skin receives the full benefits of each product.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe order of application is incredibly important,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cThe skin\u2019s job is to keep things out, but many of the skin care products we use have ingredients we want to get in. Only a very small amount of these key ingredients can penetrate the skin, even when perfectly formulated and perfectly applied. If you don\u2019t apply products in the correct order, you will not see the best results from your skin care regimen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So which product goes on top of what, you ask? An easy rule of thumb to follow is to apply your products with the thinnest consistency to thickest, or from liquid to oil. \u201cIn general, think thin-to-thick, but you also want to first use the products with the ingredients that are most important to penetrate into the skin (like antioxidants in serums) and finish with the products that need to sit on top of the skin (like emollients and humectants in moisturizers),\u201d says Dr. Rogers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The morning routine is all about protection from the sun, pollution and the elements, according to Dr. Rogers, so leave your peel pads and treatment products, like retinol, for night.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the morning, start by splashing your face with warm water or, if you must, wash with a gentle face cleanser designed for your skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most people choose to skip toners, partly because there\u2019s\u00a0a lingering assumption that most toners are harsh and irritate the skin. Fortunately, that\u2019s not the case anymore. While they don\u2019t physically \u201cshrink\u201d pores, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Toners++Mists_300083.htm\">the new breed of toners</a> can serve multiple purposes, like act as a delivery system for antioxidants, vitamin B derivatives and even toning acids. Additionally, each type of toner is intended for a different skin issue, so it\u2019s important to use the right kind for your skin concern.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, if you have lived all your life without using a toner and your skin looks healthy, Dr. Rogers says there is no need to start using one. \u201cToners were created to help return the skin\u2019s pH after it became too basic from harsh soaps,\u201d explains Dr. Rogers. \u201cFace cleansers\u00a0are now so much better balanced than toners are not a required step for me, particularly in the morning when your face is clean from being washed the night before. Alcohol-based toners contribute to over-drying of the skin by stripping the protective oils, and water-based toners are a poor vehicle for getting active ingredients into the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-are-face-serums/\">Serums</a>\u00a0are super-concentrated, nutrient-dense treatments that address specific concerns, so it\u2019s better to keep them as close to the skin as possible. There are various serums available on the market today, but for daytime, Dr. Rogers recommends\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/antioxidants-in-skin-care/\">antioxidant serums</a>, which provide a variety of benefits\u2014from blunting your skin\u2019s inflammatory response to neutralizing damage from UV rays and environmental pollutants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to board-certified dermatologist Annie Chiu, it\u2019s vital to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/why-use-an-eye-cream/\">apply an eye cream </a>at least every night, if not twice a day, starting in your 20s. \u201cIt\u2019s about maintaining the health and thickness of the eyelid skin. Improving the skin quality in this area early on ensures that the eyelid skin does not easily lose laxity and its smooth appearance later on.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For best results, consistency is key. \u201cRegular use of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eye+Cream_300080.htm\">eye cream</a> over time will keep the eyelid skin elastic and can improve or prevent against some fine lines or collagen loss. Remember: Nothing is magic. Results don\u2019t occur overnight,\u201d Dr. Chiu adds. \u201cYou can further protect the delicate skin around your eyes by choosing an eye cream with SPF or applying <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">sunscreen</a> every day.\u201d Dr. Chiu also advises people to remember to wear sunglasses when outside to protect against UV-light damage and lines that can creep up around the corners of your eyes from squinting.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Diane De Fiori, dermatologist at Rosacea Treatment Clinic, prescription medications and acne spot treatments, like serums, need to be applied as close to the skin as possible to maximize their benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As acne spot treatments differ in active ingredients, check your product packaging or consult your dermatologist for the best way to apply it. Prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide, a common acne spot treatment ingredient, has a one- to three-hour working time, according to esthetician and acne specialist\u00a0Ashley Wiley. \u201cAny cream that comes in contact with it before it has completed its work will likely inhibit the active ingredient from working properly.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember that acne spot treatments can dry out your skin, so always apply only on spots where you need it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yes, everyone needs a moisturizer, even if you have oily skin. \u201cEven though your body has its own natural lubricating system consisting of glands that secrete oil (or sebum) to maintain a protective coating against harsh outside conditions and infections, most of us do need extra hydration after the havoc that sun, weather and harsh chemicals wreak on our skin,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist Sandra Kopp.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most experts recommend that the best time to apply a moisturizer is while the skin is still damp, so the sooner you go through applying your serum and treatment, the sooner you\u2019re able to lock in much-needed hydration with your moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re using an acne spot treatment, you may want to skip those areas when applying your moisturizer to make sure the ingredients in it won\u2019t interfere with the active ingredients in your spot treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sunscreen should be the last step in your daytime skin care routine if you\u2019re using a physical or mineral sunscreen, which works by physically blocking the UV rays. This step becomes tricky when you\u2019re using a chemical sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Rogers explains: \u201cChemical sunscreens have to be absorbed into the skin to be effective, so applying after your moisturizer will delay and hinder that. However, if you apply your chemical sunscreen before your moisturizer, your moisturizer will not work as well either because the skin is coated with chemical sunscreen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So to get around this, and for many other reasons, Dr. Rogers always recommend using a physical sunscreen with zinc and to apply it after your moisturizer. \u201cZinc is safe, effective and provides the broadest protection against UVA and UVB rays.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for those who like using chemical sunscreens, try to look for formulas that offer moisturizing benefits, so you can get your daily hydration needs while protecting your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As your skin naturally repairs itself at night, your nighttime routine should be all about treatment and giving your skin what it needs, says Dr. Rogers. \u201cIf your skin is looking dull, exfoliate. If it is irritated, hydrate and protect.\u201d Here\u2019s the best order of skin care products to make sure you get the most out of them:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To get rid of the day\u2019s grime, dirt, oil and makeup, some experts recommend removing your makeup first with a dedicated makeup remover before washing your face with a gentle cleanser. Better yet, try <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-skin-care-secrets-to-steal-from-asian-women/\">double cleansing</a>,\u00a0which involves using a cleansing oil first to dissolve your makeup and then washing your face again with your regular cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe first step is to take off your makeup. This is the step where you would typically use a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Deep+Cleansing+Oil_37986.htm\">cleansing oil</a>,\u201d explains cosmetic acupuncturist and herbalist <a href=\"http://www.acufunkture.com/\">Kathleen Funk</a>. \u201cThe second step is to use a face wash to remove all the excess sebum, dirt and makeup you loosened up on the first step. This leaves your skin fresh and perfectly prepped to absorb your skin regimen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>TIP:</strong> If you\u2019re using a physical exfoliant, like a facial scrub, use it in place of your cleanser after removing your makeup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you use a toner, apply it as you would in the morning.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At night, some people also like to layer various types of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/korean-skin-care-routine/\">skin care boosters</a>, which you\u2019ll see as either mists, essences, beauty waters or hydrating (hyaluronic acid) serums. These are infused with different active ingredients, but for the most part, the purpose is mainly to hydrate and nourish skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since these are lightweight, almost water-like formulas, apply them after washing your face as you would a toner. \u201cIf using both, apply toner then essence,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cToner is more to clean and essence is more about delivering a treatment.\u201d If using multiple boosters, same rules apply: apply from thinnest to thickest.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from addressing crow\u2019s feet and dark circles, eye creams can also serve to protect your delicate eye area from your other skin care products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cGenerally, you\u2019d want to apply your eye cream before your treatments to protect your eye area against potent ingredients, which could potentially cause irritation,\u201d according to Dr. Rogers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like the rest of the body, skin does the bulk of its repairing, restoring and regenerating as we sleep. This is why most targeted skin care treatments\u2014like prescription meds (tretinoin, acne and rosacea creams), retinol creams, exfoliative treatments (peel pads and masks) and anti-aging serums (infused with peptides, growth factors and other biologically active ingredients)\u2014are better used at night. However, instead of layering up all your treatment serums and creams, Dr. Rogers suggests choosing your evening treatment depending on your skin\u2019s of-the-moment needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cToo many steps just increase the risk of irritation and decrease the likelihood of the desired result,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cPick your evening treatment based on what your skin needs that night, not based on what you have in your medicine cabinet. Some nights, it may be just wash, moisturize and bed. There is always tomorrow to give your skin more love.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are other considerations:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your skin is on the dry side, you may want to add a hydrating cream mask or face oil. Both product types are generally mild and can be typically used as often as your skin needs an extra boost of hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some people use the same moisturizer in the day and at night. However, night moisturizers or night creams are generally thicker and heavier, and designed to be absorbed over the course of several hours.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMoisturizer, particularly the heavier ones used at night, create a protective coating on the skin to prevent water evaporation while you sleep,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cMaintaining a high water content in the skin is key for healing and maintaining healthy skin. If you are using the right moisturizer, it should be your last step because nothing is going to get through it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from the order of application, some experts believe it\u2019s also important to consider the time it takes for your skin to absorb your products. However, since most of us are often in a rush to get somewhere (or hit the sack), Dr. Rogers understands that this isn\u2019t always possible. Her advice? Keep your skin care routine simple.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMany products say you have to wait anywhere from five to 30 minutes before the next step to ensure proper absorption, but who has time for that? If you make it too complicated, you just won\u2019t do it,\u201d says Dr. Rogers. \u201cIf you have many steps, pause for a bit (a minute) to allow each product time to react with the skin. For example, at night, after I wash my face and apply my serum or evening treatment, I just wrap up my day and get into bed. I keep my moisturizer on my bedside table and apply it right before I go to sleep to give these typically expensive, specialty treatments a touch more time to penetrate the skin before I seal them in with my cream.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another piece of advice? Listen to your skin. Remember that you are unique and that nobody else has your skin. No matter what experts say, it\u2019s important to find what works for you and to always be kind to your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need a quick reference on how to go about your skin care routine?\u00a0Check out our ultimate cheat sheet below.</p>"},

You\u2019re not alone. Almost half of the American population admits to having <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_10-Signs-You-Have-Sensitive-Skin_2076.htm\">\u201c</a><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_10-Signs-You-Have-Sensitive-Skin_2076.htm\">sensitive\u201d or \u201cvery sensitive\u201d skin</a>\u00a0that often\u00a0suffers from these symptoms. The good news is that by pinpointing the true cause of your condition, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_How-to-Reduce-Redness-on-the-Face_1934.htm\">finding the best\u00a0solution</a> won\u2019t be as daunting. See if any of these common skin conditions might be the reason behind the unexplained redness on your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The most common type of eczema, atopic dermatitis usually presents as red, itchy patches on the arms, cheeks and legs. (The operative word being <em>itchy</em>!) A number of factors can cause eczema to flare up, from stress to extreme temperatures to allergens like mold, pollen and pet dander.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Symptoms: </strong>Dry, scaly skin; redness; itching; cracks behind the ears; open, crusted or \u201cweepy\u201d sores</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal:</strong> Take shorter, cooler showers and baths using a lipid-enriched soap for gentle cleansing. Hard water can be harsh on the skin, so be sure to add a liquid emollient to bathwater; some experts recommend oatmeal baths for soothing. Taking evening primrose oil can also help ease the itchiness. Board-certified dermatologist Michael Swann suggests using a ceramide-based moisturizer, which can do \u201creal repair of the damaged skin barrier.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those pesky dandruff flakes might signify that more than just your scalp is in need of some TLC. Dandruff can often be a symptom of seborrheic dermatitis\u2014which happens on not only the scalp but also other oil-producing parts of the body (like the face, upper chest and back). One of the eight types of eczema, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Seborrheic+Dermatitis_400028.htm\">seborrheic dermatitis</a>,\u201d can be triggered by stress, hormonal changes and/or cold, dry weather.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Redness; greasy or scaly scalp; crusty flakes; itchiness; burning</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal:</strong> For scalp woes, try using a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dandruff+Shampoo_502191.htm\">medicated dandruff shampoo</a>; look for ingredients like selenium sulfide, coal tar, ketoconazole or zinc pyrithione. \u201cOver-the-counter shampoos can work really well,\u201d says Swann, who favors Nizoral for his patients. For other parts of the skin, a topical <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Anti-Fungal_400066.htm\">antifungal cream</a>, might do the trick. Also, avoid using harsh detergents and soaps.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Feeling flush? Those rosy cheeks could be the first sign that you\u2019re experiencing rosacea. Most commonly experienced by women over 30, rosacea mainly affects the face and can manifest as redness, bumps or pimples, an enlarged nose or eye irritation, depending on the subtype. Though the cause is still unknown, some experts believe that rosacea could be caused by disorders of the vascular and/or nervous systems.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Frequent blushing or flushing; persistent redness; pus-filled pimples and/or small red bumps (sometimes accompanied by burning or stinging); visible blood vessels; itching or tightness</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal:\u00a0</strong>A gentle cleansing routine can work wonders! Use a mild, nonabrasive facial cleanser, then rinse with lukewarm water and blot dry with a thick cotton towel. To combat redness, consider using a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/best-foundations-for-rosacea/\">skin-correcting foundation for sensitive skin</a> (favoring yellow over pink or orange hues). Swann recommends using a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">mineral-based sunscreen</a>. For more serious cases, \u201cvascular laser treatment can be very effective,\u201d he adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Cyndi Lauper deal with this difficult autoimmune disease that causes red, scaly patches in areas like the elbows, knees, scalp and lower back. (It happens when skin cells turn over too fast and start to pile up on the surface before they can mature.) Psoriasis is hereditary, but can also be triggered by skin injuries (like sunburns and scratches), stress or certain medications, such as lithium or beta blockers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Red patches of skin covered with silvery scales; dry, cracked or bleeding skin; itching; burning</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal:</strong> Light therapy and topical corticosteroids are often prescribed, but at-home remedies like vitamin D creams, coal tar gels and ointments, retinoids and bath solutions like Dead Sea salts can help. Using products with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/salicylic-acid-products/\">salicylic acid</a> can also soothe scaly skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Got AK? Blame it on too much sun exposure (or the tanning bed). Actinic keratosis starts out as sandpapery spots on the skin and progresses into scaly, crusty growths measuring less than an inch. The vast majority are benign, but about 10 percent can advance to squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer)\u2014so it\u2019s vital to see a dermatologist if AK develops.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Itching or burning; rough patches of skin that can\u2019t be seen, but feel painful when rubbed; dry lips; raised, red, scaly bumps</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to Deal:</strong>\u00a0Early treatment and diagnosis is key! Doctors often prescribe topical creams containing 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or imiquimod; products containing <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/\">hyaluronic acid</a> may also be helpful.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many of the symptoms for these skin conditions can mimic each other, so it\u2019s wise to see a dermatologist who can better decipher the puzzle. \u201cThe common thread is inflammation, so we just have to dig deeper to determine the cause,\u201d says Swann. \u201cThe devil is in the details.\u201d</p>"},

Blame that in part on celebrities, who regularly post selfies with their LED light masks that claim to target acne and help them get that red-carpet glow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cLED therapy has gained popularity because it has been mentioned more and more in the media and on social media, especially by celebrities,\u201d says\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.realself.com/find/New-York/New-York/Dermatologic-Surgeon/Sejal-Shah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Sejal Shah</a>, board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf contributor in New York City. \u201cBut I believe people like LED therapy because it is non-invasive, painless and can actually be effective,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But what exactly are LED lights and how do they work? Read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It seems too good to be true: You shine an LED light over your face and the problem areas go away. While that really is how it works, there\u2019s a lot more going on under the surface that only science can explain. It turns out, there\u2019s a powerful source of energy in that tiny light.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cLED (light emitting diode) therapy is a form of low-level light energy that penetrates the skin to cause different reactions and target different issues,\u201d explains Dr. Robin Evans, board-certified dermatologist at\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.socodermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Southern Connecticut Dermatology</a>. \u201cThis type of energy in the wavelength spectrum of 600\u20131300 nanometers can penetrate deep into the skin and be absorbed. This can result in skin rejuvenation, repair of tissue and promotion of wound healing. The energy can also target bacteria, inflammation and stimulate collagen.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No matter what problem your skin has\u2014including breakouts or signs of aging, LED light therapy might be able to help. \u201cThe light energy can destroy bacteria, which can be beneficial for acne,\u201d Evans says. \u201cIt can also target inflammation, which is beneficial for rosacea and acne-prone skin. It also stimulates collagen, which acts as an anti-aging treatment against fine lines and wrinkles\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another benefit, unlike other skin treatments (extractions, we\u2019re looking at you!), is that LED light therapy is for the most part pain-free. An LED light doesn\u2019t heat the skin like a tanning bed would, so there won\u2019t be any thermal damage (the exception is an infrared light.) \u00a0\u201cGenerally, you\u2019ll have minimal to no downtime with very little discomfort,\u201d Evans adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are different colors of LED light available. Each offers a unique benefit for the skin, Shah says. Here\u2019s a breakdown of how each works:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">LED light therapy for at-home use might not be as powerful as the ones your dermatologist uses, but they can still be highly effective. Here\u2019s what else you should consider before making a purchase:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Almost all skin types can use an LED light at home, Evans says. However, avoid them if your skin is inflamed or irritated, or if you have any rashes on the areas being treated, she recommends. \u201cAnyone with open wounds or possible infections should see their dermatologist prior to trying any of these treatments,\u201d she stresses.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She also recommends following all package directions (some come with goggles to protect your eyes, for example) and testing an LED light on your skin for a shorter amount of time to start. If you don\u2019t have any reaction, use the device several times a week for best results. \u201cKeep in mind that home devices are not as powerful as in-office treatments, so generally they need to be used more frequently and require more of a time commitment to see results,\u201d Shah adds.</p>"},

Yep, you heard right. Stem cells, the same ones used in innovative medical research to treat Alzheimer\u2019s and certain types of cancer, are now being sold over the counter in the form of creams, serums and other skin care products. Except there\u2019s one major difference here: These stems cells are usually derived from plants (or occasionally animals). However, they work similarly to human stem cells and may offer anti-aging benefits for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Human <a href=\"https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/basics/1.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stem cells</a> are unique because of their ability to divide. In certain organs, they can even become specialized to repair and replace damaged tissues. \u201cStem\u00a0cells\u00a0are rapidly dividing\u00a0cells\u00a0in the body that have the ability to give rise to more\u00a0stems\u00a0cells\u00a0or become other types of\u00a0cells\u00a0with more specialized function,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.realself.com/find/New-York/New-York/Dermatologic-Surgeon/Sejal-Shah\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Sejal Shah</a>, board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf contributor in New York City. Plant stem cells serve similar functions, she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both plant and human stem cells contain proteins and amino acids, adds Dr. <a href=\"https://www.realself.com/find/New-York/New-York-City/Dermatologist/Michele-Green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michele Green</a>, board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf contributor in New York City. \u201cThese signal the body\u2019s cells to rejuvenate and may result in younger-looking skin,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As mentioned above,\u00a0stem\u00a0cells\u00a0contain amino acids and peptides, which are skin care powerhouse ingredients for skin rejuvenation. \u201cThese are the building blocks for\u00a0cell\u00a0rejuvenation, so over the past few years, there have been a variety of both animal- and plant-based\u00a0stem\u00a0cells\u00a0in skin care products,\u201d explains Green. \u201cStem\u00a0cells\u00a0naturally have antioxidant properties and they nourish skin\u00a0cells\u00a0which promotes\u00a0cell turnover and increases collagen production.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This could result in fewer lines and wrinkles, improved skin texture and tone, and younger, better-looking skin, she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But keep in mind, it\u2019s not actually living stem cells that you\u2019re seeing in your face cream, Shah notes. \u201cMost cell skin care products contain plant stem cells, and more specifically, stem cell extracts.\u201d That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, though. She says these extracts are often rich in antioxidants and may provide growth factors to help renew and repair the skin. \u201cThe extracts themselves can benefit the skin, but it\u2019s not accurate to think that part of this type of product will then become a new skin\u00a0cell. Remember, plant\u00a0cells\u00a0cannot become human\u00a0cells,\u00a0and they are no longer living once they have been processed and added into skin care.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://greenbergcosmeticsurgery.com/about-us/about-dr-lupenko/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Eve Lupenko</a>, board-certified dermatologist at Greenberg Cosmetic Surgery in New York City, is starting to use treatments containing plant-derived stem cells in her practice. \u201cThe reason why we prefer to use plant stem cells is that you don\u2019t have to worry about transmitting human and animal diseases,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are seeing plant-based stem cells in skin care products these days because they repair the skin on a cellular level (a much deeper level). Most regular skin care products don\u2019t penetrate into those areas of the actual skin cells.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The efficacy of stem cells in skin care depends on who you ask. Some dermatologists like Lupenko swear by them. \u201cStem cells have the potential to repair skin cells, and they also protect your skin from external factors and create a more youthful look,\u201d she says. \u201cThey go into the skin\u2019s cellular level, and they are able to deliver moisture and reparative agents to where they need to go.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Others aren\u2019t convinced about why exactly stem cells are suddenly buzzing in the skin care world. \u201cThey can be rich in antioxidants and often contain hydrators and moisturizers, so they can be good for the skin,\u201d Shah says. \u201cBut do I think they are more effective than non-stem cell products? Not necessarily.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Green sees the potential in using stem cells in conjunction with other treatments. \u201cThe products work, however, you can improve the benefits dramatically with other procedures such as the Fraxel laser, thermage, injectable fillers, botox and PRP, a mix of micro-needling with platelet-rich plasma.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re interested in trying out stem cells, work with your dermatologist to determine which products would work best for your skin, recommends Lupenko. \u201cIt\u2019s important to use them regularly if you\u2019d like to see results,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And even though you might find some stem cell products derived from animals, Green recommends sticking with plant-based stem cells. \u201cThere\u2019s more research in their efficacy,\u201d she says.</p>"},

But in the fall season, cosmetic physician\u00a0</span><a href=\"http://www.drkovaklaser.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Stanley Kovak</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0says chemical peels and <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-microdermabrasion/\">microdermabrasion</a> are an ideal course of action right after summer before fall activities start booking up your calendar. Because you\u2019ll need at least a few days up to a week to recover at home, you want to make sure you block out healing time.

However, due to their photoreactive nature, they can make your skin more susceptible to sun damage, so they\u2019re usually not recommended in the summertime. In the fall, though, they can be used more frequently, as long as you don\u2019t experience redness or pain.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.janetprystowskymd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dermatologist Dr. Janet H. Prystowsky</a> explains that these creams work to gradually shed a layer of skin, not only cleansing your skin from summer\u2019s impact but making it look younger, too. She also adds that <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-best-serums-to-try-for-brighter-skin/\">skin-brightening serums</a>\u2014both with vitamin C or without it\u2014can improve the condition of your pores, without being as intense as retinol varieties.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+05+Refining+Night+Cream_4506.htm\">SkinCeuticals Retinol 0.5 Refining Night Cream</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While you might have been hyperfocused on reapplying sunscreen to your face, it\u2019s not just your cheeks and forehead that battled through summer. As Dr. Kovak explains, your <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-treat-sunburn/\">neck, chest and hands</a> also received a big brunt of UV exposure and they deserve some autumn TLC, too. To repair other parts of your body, he suggests opting for a photo facial laser treatment, which is a more extensive rejuvenation treatment that improves the overall look of the skin by diminishing brown spots and blotchiness while improving collagen and elastic fibers throughout your skin\u2019s several layers. How does it work? Pulses of light are used to penetrate deep into your skin, which causes your blood vessels to constrict.

As Dr. Kovak reminds, \u201cRejuvenating the skin after the summer\u2019s damage is important for the overall appearance and health of our skin and ultimately prepares us for the winter season, which can be as damaging to our skin as the summer season,\u201d he says. While you\u2019re cooking dinner (or tuning in to the return of your favorite primetime shows), apply a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/face-masks-for-dry-skin/\">moisturizing face mask</a> that will seep into your pores, helping them to replenish after weeks of dry heat. He also adds that your morning routine should still consist of applying a moisturizer with an SPF, but that you can opt for a thicker formula now that summer is coming to a close. And if you do nothing else, drink plenty of water! Good old-fashioned H2O is always a smart choice for your skin as it keeps it fresh, hydrated and healthy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try</strong>:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Hungarian+Thermal+Water+MineralRich+Moisturizer+_74938.htm\">Peter Thomas Roth Hungarian Thermal Water Mineral-Rich Moisturizer</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Consider everything your feet have been through for the past few months: trekking down stony or sandy beaches, squeezing into damp water shoes, trailblazing through rocky paths in thick hiking boots, fighting sweat (and ahem, stink) in athletic shoes and much more.

And while it\u2019s true that it\u2019s a powerful and effective skincare ingredient, some dermatologists are concerned about its side effects and long-term effects from use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That worry has led to a new wave in natural skin care lightening alternatives. (You may have noticed that botanicals and vitamin C are buzzing these days.) Here\u2019s a look at some natural alternatives and what they can do for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chemical brightening agents like hydroquinone work by blocking key enzymes along the melanin (pigment) producing pathway in the body. But about five years ago, researchers began questioning the safety of hydroquinone because users were at risk for developing ochronosis, a condition that (ironically) darkens the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cHydroquinone is one of the most researched and studied lightening agents, but can cause severe irritation and hyperpigmentation if not used correctly,\u201d explains Dr. <a href=\"https://www.realself.com/find/New-York/New-York-City/Dermatologist/Michele-Green\">Michele Green</a>, board-certified dermatologist and RealSelf contributor in New York City. Plus, it was banned in the E.U. because it contains carcinogens, which may increase the risk for cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those side effects are enough to have some doctors concerned, explains Dr. Robin Evans, board-certified dermatologist at <a href=\"https://www.socodermatology.com/\">Southern Connecticut Dermatology</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSafety concerns have been limiting the use of hydroquinone, pushing the prevalence of newer hydroquinone-free lightening agents,\u201d she explains. \u201cThese products can help with brightening, smoothing the skin and exfoliating, which will brighten and will have some minimal effects on lightening. They can also help with pigmentary problems like melasma.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re ready to go <em>au natural</em> to brighten up your skin, consider the following ingredients.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cLicorice root contains two ingredients that help with pigmentation: glabridin and liquiritin,\u201d explains Green. \u201cGlabridin helps to retrain tyrosinase, an enzyme that produces melanin which leads to pigmentation. Liquiritin helps to break up and remove melanin and pigmentation in the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to helping with dark spots, licorice can be soothing and help even out your skin tone. Look for it in products like serums and use daily for best results. You can also apply a licorice root\u2013infused exfoliating peel a few times a week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kojic acid is derived from mushroom-like fungi during fermentation, and is the second most common natural lightening agent, Green says. \u201cIt prohibits the production of melanin and penetrates the upper layers of the skin causing a lightening effect.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can find kojic acid in serums and depigmentation cream. Unfortunately, it can cause some side effects like redness and irritation. Always use a low-dose (1 percent) version and test it on your skin first before use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cArbutin is a natural form of hydroquinone derived from the bearberry plant,\u201d Green says. \u201cIt is a safer and effective alternative to hydroquinone and is less cytotoxic to the melanocytes.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Look for arbutin in brightening face lotions and dark spot correctors. Use it gradually in the first few weeks to make sure your skin doesn\u2019t react negatively. You can then increase the frequency of use. Also, as always, make sure you are wearing sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And even though it\u2019s considered natural, avoid arbutin if you are pregnant because it is a derivative of hydroquinone, says Evans. (The effects of arbutin haven\u2019t been studied, but hydroquinone is not considered pregnancy-safe.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your favorite tropical fruit may help brighten your skin, too. \u201cPapaya contains alpha hydroxy acids, which are effective in cell turnover and exfoliation,\u201d Green says. \u201cAnd papain (an enzyme found in papaya) exfoliates the skin, giving you a lighter, brighter complexion.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can find <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-papaya-has-done-to-my-adult-acne/\">papaya and papain in many products</a> these days, including cleansers, peels, masks and exfoliating scrubs. It is generally considered safe (follow product directions for use). But always test it on your skin first to confirm you aren\u2019t allergic and won\u2019t have a bad reaction.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201c<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\">Niacinamide</a>, or vitamin B3, can be used to fade age spots and lighten discoloration of the skin,\u201d Green says. \u201cIt\u2019s effective with hyperpigmentation because it decreases the number of melanin transferred to pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) to skin cells by more than half. It doesn\u2019t stop the production of melanin, but it reduces the amount that is transferred to the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s more, she says, it is extremely stable and not affected by heat or light like other chemical ingredients. Niacinamide is found in serums and boosters that are usually considered safe to use daily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C is another popular brightening alternative found in <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-vitamin-c-serums/\">many brightening serums</a>. \u201cVitamin C is an amazing antioxidant that is beneficial for patients with hyperpigmentation,\u201d says Green. \u201cIt works by brightening hyperpigmented spots on the skin, but not lightening normal skin.\u201d What\u2019s more, she says it can help to create the healthy, glowing skin you\u2019re after.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Green says to avoid vitamin C if you have allergies or sensitive skin, though. It can cause redness, irritation and tingling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWillow bark extract is a beta hydroxy acid that helps to exfoliate the skin and encourage cell turnover,\u201d Evans explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That\u2019s because it\u2019s related to salicylic acid, Green adds. \u201cWhite Willow Bark extract is composed of salicin, the natural form of salicylic acid,\u201d she says. \u201cSalicylic acid helps to shed dead skin cells from your skin to allow new and healthy skin cells to regenerate.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can find willow bark extract in spot treatments, serums and exfoliating peels. Some of the products like spot treatments can be used daily, while exfoliating peels should only be used once or twice a week.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin or are just looking for something mild, products containing lactic acid may be what you need. \u201cLactic acid is derived from sour milk and is an alpha hydroxy acid, so it is one of the mildest ingredients you can use for skin lightening,\u201d Green explains. \u201cGentle enough for sensitive skin, lactic acid penetrates the skin causing mild exfoliation. It\u2019s also a melanin suppressor.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She notes that because it decreases your melanin production, you should wear sunscreen and protective clothing to protect the treated areas from sun damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evans says natural brighteners may not be as effective as hydroquinone when it comes to lightening, but are worth a try if you are worried about its side effects.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIngredients that encourage cell turnover and peeling, inhibit melanin production or protect from the sun will all be helpful in lightening the skin to some degree,\u201d she says. \u201cMost importantly, they can help prevent further darkening of the skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just keep in mind that the above ingredients can come with side effects of their own\u2014irritation, inflammation and peeling. Work with your dermatologist to determine which products are safe for your skin.</p>"},

Many patients try to squeeze them out but ultimately fail (and instead make matters worse from the trauma of picking).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t let these small yet stubborn cysts frustrate you. A lot can be done to treat and prevent milia, but first, one needs to understand what they are and why they occur.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Milia_500880.htm\">Milia</a></em> is the medical term for small, keratin-filled cysts that can be seen in all age groups. These cysts can be solitary (milium) or appear in clusters (milia). They are most commonly seen in infants as tiny, firm, whitish bumps on the cheeks or around the nose and eyes. Nearly half of all infants develop them. Adults can develop milia on the face as well, including very delicate areas like the eyelids. Milia can even form on the arms or hands, especially in older patients with severe sun-damaged (think leathery) skin or those with certain acquired or genetic skin conditions associated with blistering. In all cases, however, milia are benign and treatment is not necessary since they can eventually go away on their own.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Milia form as a consequence of the skin\u2019s localized inability to naturally exfoliate. Dead skin cells\u2014composed predominantly of keratin, a protein also found in hair and nails\u2014build up underneath, causing a bump to form. Unlike acne, milia are cysts, do not form from a pore and typically do not get inflamed or develop redness or swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So what needs to be done? In most cases, nothing. In due time all milia will resolve spontaneously, so it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to leave them alone. However, when waiting is not an option, especially for those with very persistent or cosmetically bothersome milia, <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Milia_500880.htm\">treatment should be considered</a>\u00a0with the help of your dermatologist. Here are some things you can do.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Products that boost exfoliation and cell turnover keep the skin smooth and thin, thereby eradicating milia and preventing them from recurring. I highly recommend <strong><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Micro-Exfoliating+Scrub_29856.htm\">Skinceuticals Micro-Exfoliating Scrub</a></strong>, which is gentle enough to use daily without leaving the skin overly dry or irritated. After slightly wetting your fingers, massage this product along your face using small circular motions. Just a few minutes is all you\u00a0need to give your skin an instantly smoother feel and appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Products containing glycolic acid and retinol are also fantastic milia-busters. These products are considered very safe, but some caution is needed when using these products around the eyes where skin is thinner and inherently more prone to irritation. Glycolic acid is available in over-the-counter creams or gels in 20% or lower concentrations. Consistent use of this natural alpha-hydroxy acid at low doses gives the skin a consistent rate of exfoliation without excess irritation. <strong><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Glycolic+Acid+10+Percent+Hydrating+Gel_11602.htm\">Peter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating Gel</a></strong> does an excellent job of exfoliating without leaving the skin too dry. A thin layer applied every other evening is typically sufficient to give your skin a brighter and smoother appearance. Let the product dry for 10 minutes, then apply a moisturizer on top before going to bed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Retinol is another milia-eradicating ingredient. Nightly use of low concentrations, like that found in <strong><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Age+Defense+Retinol+Complex+1.0_55452.htm\">Skin Medica Retinol Complex 1.0</a>, </strong>gently increases the skin\u2019s cell turnover rate, revealing a fresh smooth layer. For those with sensitive skin, it\u2019s wise to start with a thin layer applied only every other night before ramping up to daily use. Remember to always follow up with an evening moisturizer to counteract dryness and irritation. For especially stubborn or numerous milia, prescription retinol creams (like Retin-A or generic tretinoin 0.025%\u20130.05% cream or gel) may be in order. Consult your dermatologist to discuss these options.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those who simply can\u2019t wait the number of weeks required for topical exfoliating treatments to work their magic, manual extraction by your dermatologist can provide a quicker solution. A sterile needle or blade is used initially to create a small opening in the cyst. Afterwards, the bump can either be left alone to spontaneously decompress with routine cleansing or exfoliating, or extraction using a comedone extractor can be done to remove the cyst manually by gentle pressure. In skilled hands, little trauma and no scarring should be produced. I caution my patients against doing this at home on themselves. Improper technique can cause excess skin trauma leading to hyperpigmentation (dark marks) or even permanent scarring.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best course of action, of course, is to not get them in the first place. This is why sunscreen is critical. Sun damage is a known contributor to milia formation, so every morning your routine must include application of sunscreen (at least an SPF 30). I recommend <strong><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Daily+Broad-Spectrum+SPF+40_10106.htm\">EltaMD UV Daily Broad-Spectrum SPF 40</a></strong> because it contains micronized zinc oxide (which provides the optimum sun protection by blocking both UVA and UVB radiation). It feels light, smooth and non-greasy on the face. It won\u2019t leave a white sheen or increase breakouts. Apply after cleansing and moisturizing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a solid routine in place which incorporates daily sun protection, gentle exfoliation at home and in-office extraction as needed, your skin could\u00a0be smooth, radiant and milia-free!</p>"},

These devices keep us in the know, help us stay organized and sometimes entertained before falling asleep. Yet, they also emit blue light\u00a0that can potentially damage our skin, according to recent studies, leading to premature aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most of us are aware that the sun produces invisible ultraviolet rays, which can help the body manufacture vitamin D but at the same time age and burn our skin. But what most of us don\u2019t know is that the visible rays produced by the sun come in many different colors\u2014red, orange, yellow, green, blue and many shades in between. Red light has a longer wavelength and therefore produces less energy; on the other end of the spectrum, blue light has a shorter\u00a0wavelength (400\u2013495) and falls within the spectrum of high energy visible (HEV) light, which means\u2014you guessed it!\u2014it produces more energy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Like ultraviolet rays, blue light has both benefits and dangers.\u00a0Natural exposure to blue light during the day helps us stay alert, boosts our attention span and lifts our mood. At night, exposure to it can hurt our eyes and\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side\">disrupt our sleep pattern, </a>throwing our circadian rhythm out of whack\u2014and this can prove <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/lack-of-sleep-and-skin/\">problematic for our skin</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During shut-eye, our body\u2014and skin\u2014recuperates and repairs itself, which is one of the many benefits of getting adequate sleep. Sleep deprivation, according to\u00a0plastic surgeon and dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aafprs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Mary Lynn Moran, MD</a>, causes an elevation of cortisol, the stress hormone, interfering with our bodies\u2019 ability to mend itself overnight. \u201cOur cells regenerate while we sleep, so if we don\u2019t get good quality sleep, they are unable to repair themselves, leaving us looking older,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s more, HEV is capable of penetrating the skin more deeply than UV rays, deep down where elastin and hyaluronic acid are produced. It may also degrade antioxidants in the skin and increase free radicals, which can lead to accelerated skin aging.\u00a0It has also been shown to contribute to dark spots or hyperpigmentation, per <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888214\">this finding</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With technology ownership ever growing, our exposure to blue light only increases. In fact, a <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/02/millennials-stand-out-for-their-technology-use-but-older-generations-also-embrace-digital-life/\">2018 Pew Research Center</a> study found that 67% of older U.S. adults own a smartphone compared to 92% of millennials. What\u2019s worse, having blue light\u2013emitting devices closer to our skin or pressed against our faces may heighten the effects of blue light and accelerate the appearance of wrinkles, saggy or loose skin and dark spots. But don\u2019t fret just yet. While we can\u2019t always avoid being exposed to blue-light damage, there may be a way to up our skin\u2019s defense against it:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Lumivive+System_77934.htm\">SkinMedica\u2019s LUMIVIVE\u2122 System.</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Currently the only skin care system on the market that offers an all-around approach to the detrimental effects of blue light,\u00a0LUMIVIVE\u2122 System\u00a0works in three ways: it\u00a0recharges the skin\u2019s ability to repair itself, enhances your overall skin care regimen and defends the skin from environmental aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The system includes two formulas: the LUMIVIVE\u2122 DAY Damage Defense Serum (a protective day serum) and the LUMIVIVE\u2122 NIGHT Revitalize Repair Complex (a reparative night serum). Together, this multitasking duo work synergistically to not only help the skin repair itself but also shield it from constant exposure to environmental aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When used as directed, this system has been shown to diminish visible signs of damage, like redness, wrinkles and\u00a0discoloration,\u00a0for a healthier-looking complexion.\u00a0In\u00a0a\u00a012-week clinical study on 300 patients in two of the most polluted cities in the world (New Delhi and Beijing), results showed improvement in the overall radiance, visible redness and appearance of skin discoloration in just eight weeks. These findings indicate that even in the most polluted environments, the LUMIVIVE\u2122 System can help protect skin from pollution-induced damage and reverse signs of existing damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to SkinMedica, this unique system works for a full 24 hours without washing off of the skin regardless of daily activity. For best results,\u00a0use this with your anti-aging serum, like the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_TNS+Essential+Serum_16498.htm\">TNS Serum</a>, as well as\u00a0a sunscreen, like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Total+Defense+Repair+SPF+34_63552.htm\">Total Defense + Repair SPF 34</a>. When used together, antioxidants and broad-spectrum sunscreens provide the most complete protection against visible aging caused by environmental aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulated with a blend of antioxidants and peptides, these day-and-night serums work to reduce uneven pigmentation, free radical damage and redness. Clinically proven to restore skin tone evenness in just eight weeks, this two-step system helps improve overall radiance, visible radiance and discoloration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SkinMedica\u2019s TNS Essential Serum features two active formulas that work together to smooth wrinkles and regenerate skin cells for a more youthful appearance. The TNS complex is a protein- and amino acid\u2013rich serum that reduces inflammation and signs of aging. The APS corrective complex is a mixture of anti-aging ingredients, peptides and antioxidants to strengthen sagging skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SkinMedica\u2019s Total Defense Repair SPF 34 protects skin from sun damage and prevents aging due to chronic exposure to infrared and blue light. Using an advanced antioxidant complex, this restorative formula goes beyond UVA and UVB protection, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improving the skin\u2019s texture and evening skin tone, leaving you with a smooth, polished complexion.</p>"},

Originally a system of medicine developed in India more than 3,000 years ago, Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body and spirit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAyurveda\u00a0is a 5,000-year-old healing tradition from India, linked to the development of yoga that focuses on one\u2019s physical, mental and spiritual well-being,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.aestheticwellnessnyc.com/wellness-holistic-doctor-midtown-nyc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Natalya Fazylova</a>, DNP, a holistic health and wellness specialist in New York.<strong>\u00a0</strong>\u201cAyurveda has a set of fundamental principles which it uses to describe, diagnose and treat each individual body,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ayurveda emphasizes the universal connectedness, harmony and balance of all living and nonliving things. This means, in order to maintain optimal skin health and wellness, Ayurveda doesn\u2019t just focus on treating the surface of skin. Instead, it encompasses other areas of life, as well including diet, exercise and relationships, incorporating preventive and curative practices such as massage, meditation and herbal therapy. Curious to learn more? Read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike Western medicine, Ayurveda uses a \u201cwhole body\u201d approach to treat different skin conditions. \u201cRegardless if the problem is inside or outside the body, Ayurvedic principles address it as a whole body problem, not as a separate condition,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cFor example when it comes to acne, a conventional medical practitioner would most likely prescribe a client an antibiotic ointment or a topical product. An Ayurvedic specialist will look at this problem from an imbalance of one of the three doshas,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Ayurvedic medicine, doshas\u2014pitta (fire), vata (air) and kapha (water)\u2014are the energies that make up every individual and perform different physiological functions in the body. The fire element, pitta, which rests in the small intestine, is associated with digestive and metabolic function. \u201cPitta\u201d lends shine to the eyes, hair and skin. \u201cVata,\u201d composed of space and air, is seated in the colon. It is believed that vata rules thoughts and emotions. Seated in the stomach, \u201ckapha\u201d regulates immunity, internal lubrication and circulation, and the delivery of nutrients to the body. Earth- and water-based kapha is key to healing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ayurvedic practitioners believe that each individual has a unique balance of the three doshas, and that these doshas are constantly fluctuating based on diet, exercise and personal interaction; dosha imbalance, it is believed, leads to everything from changes in physical appearance to serious disease. Depending on your dosha, potential treatments to regain balance may involve a detox, changing your diet to avoid sugary or spicy foods and incorporating herbal supplements.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In an ayurvedic skin care routine, your dosha type determines everything from the best foods and drinks for your diet to the type of skin care regimen you should follow. While each person has all three doshas, there is usually one or two that dominate. Some skin types may have a combination of doshas, for example, vata-pitta or kapha-vata. Your environment may also influence your skin, so your skin care dosha may change over time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re not sure what your primary dosha is, take this\u00a0<a href=\"https://yogainternational.com/article/view/dosha-quiz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">online quiz</a> to find out, or see an Ayurveda specialist in your area. In the meantime, here are some tips on how to take care of your skin based on your dosha.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Translates to:</strong> \u201cThat which moves.\u201d Vata has a direct connection with wind and air.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin profile:</strong> Vata skin tends to be cold to the touch, dry and delicate.

But, unlike other super beauty ingredients making a splash in skin and hair care, there is a lot of controversy surrounding the cannabis-derived ingredient. Nonetheless, its beauty benefits and promising future in beauty are hard to ignore.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We tapped three experts to find out the beauty benefits of CBD oil, plus everything you need to know before trying the popular beauty trend. See what they had to say, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The cannabis plant boasts a variety of compounds\u2014also known as cannabinoids\u2014believed to contain medicinal benefits. Among these cannabinoids is cannabidiol, or CBD. \u201cOils that are pulled [from] the plant that contains a high concentration of CBD are known as CBD oils,\u201d says Dr. Alissia Zenhausern, NMD.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In order to understand how CBD oils work, it\u2019s important to know what cannabinoids are and what they do.\u00a0Cannabinoids are chemical messengers that activate a class of cell membrane receptors located throughout the body. These body receptors are part of the endocannabinoid system, which is involved in a variety of physiological processes including appetite, pain-sensation, sleep, mood and memory. Cannabinoids are either naturally produced by the body (endogenous) or outside the body (exogenous).\u00a0The cannabinoids found in marijuana and hemp, such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD, are considered exogenous, which, when consumed, also interact with cannabinoid receptors in the body and can generate similar physical and psychological effects.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are currently two known subtypes of cannabinoid receptors in the body, CB1 and CB2.\u00a0The CB1 receptor is expressed mainly in the\u00a0brain,\u00a0lungs,\u00a0liver\u00a0and\u00a0kidneys. The CB2<sub>\u00a0</sub>receptor is expressed mainly in the\u00a0immune system\u00a0and in\u00a0hematopoietic cells.\u00a0Before the CBD beauty trend took off, Dr. Zenhausern says CBD-infused drugs were most commonly used for pain management and inflammatory conditions, as \u201cCB2 receptors are most commonly found as part of the immune system [and they can] affect inflammation and pain.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, it is important to note that CBD will not produce the same euphoric sensations as THC, which means using CBD won\u2019t make you feel \u201chigh.\u201d \u201cThe way cannabinoids work is by attaching to CB1 and CB2 body receptors. However, new research has found that CBD doesn\u2019t seem to attach to either receptor directly and [might] help your body use its own cannabinoids,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although some CBD enthusiasts experiment with adding the oil into homemade beauty tinctures, the CBD beauty trend mostly refers to products formulated with the cannabinoid. Similar to other natural beauty\u2013benefiting ingredients\u2014such as <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/the-benefits-of-spirulina/\">spirulina</a>, which can be ingested on its own or used topically in a beauty product\u2014the oil is the ingredient, and the beauty product is the delivery system that helps provide the skin with the beauty benefits of CBD.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Speaking of beauty benefits, CBD is chock-full of them. So much so that some dermatologists\u2014including board-certified dermatologist, Dr. Debra Jaliman\u2014recommend the use of CBD oil for hair and skin. \u201cIt\u2019s rich in vitamins A, C and E,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cVitamin A stimulates the cells responsible for producing the tissue that keeps skin firm and healthy; vitamin C stimulates collagen production, and it helps to reduce signs of aging; [and] vitamin E blocks free radicals from the body [which] helps slow down the aging process,\u201d she continues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On top of the benefits of CBD on aging skin, it can also benefit breakout-prone complexions. \u201cBecause acne is an inflammatory condition related to overworked sebaceous-gland production, promising new research states that CBD can help reduce the production of sebum, which means CBD could become a future treatment for acne, particularly acne vulgaris, the most common form of acne associated with overproduction of sebum,\u201d says Dr. Zenhausern.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CBD beauty products might also help other inflammatory-related conditions such as skin allergies, rosacea, eczema and psoriasis. \u201cThe anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties of CBD naturally help improve irritating skin conditions including rosacea, eczema and psoriasis,\u201d Julie Winter, COO and founding partner of CBD For Life, explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Skin isn\u2019t the only thing that benefits from CBD\u2014hair can, too! Because it\u2019s rich in fatty and amino acids, it may be beneficial to your hair and nails, too. \u201cCBD and hemp oil stimulate and enhance the growth of hair through the scalp\u2019s absorption of the main fatty acids [found in CBD and hemp], omega-3, omega-6 and omega-9,\u201d says Winter.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news? Unlike THC, initial studies around CBD pose little to no sign of side effects to those who ingest it. \u201cMany small studies have looked at the safety of CBD in adults,\u201d explains Dr. Zenhausern. \u201cOf the studies done, researchers found that most adults well-tolerated CBD even at a wide range of doses. They found no significant side effects on the central nervous system. The most common side effects cited include fatigue, diarrhea and changes in appetite or weight.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for skin care, Dr. Jaliman says, \u201cNo studies have shown it to cause irritation or to aggravate sensitive skin. Research has shown CBD [beauty products are] safe to use with no unwanted side effects.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Still,\u00a0Dr. Zenhausern advises to be cautious when trying the CBD beauty trend\u2014especially if using the straight oil versus a beauty product formulated with it. \u201cEach CBD oil contains a different concentration of CBD, so it is very important to read the label and understand what it means,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from minding the concentration, it\u2019s also important to be aware of the legal issues surrounding the ingredient. \u201cIn the United States, each state has different laws when it comes to the use of CBD as well as medical marijuana,\u201d says Dr. Zenhausern. \u201cAnyone considering CBD oil should speak with their local healthcare provider for more information about the laws in their unique state as well as high-quality sources for safe CBD,\u201d she concludes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the beauty benefits of CBD excite you, there are a few ways you can include the super beauty ingredient into your regimen. One of the first, most important tips for using CBD in beauty is to do your research. \u201cResearch the CBD products you are interested in purchasing and make sure the products do not contain THC,\u201d says Winter. \u201cCBD is not FDA-regulated so consumers should be on the lookout for companies that are transparent with their test results,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another important thing to consider is the results. As with all beauty products, the types of results you wish to see should dictate the way you apply or use CBD in your regimen. \u201cConsumers can ingest CBD oil in products like tinctures for fast-acting results since it travels directly into the bloodstream. But, applying CBD topically is the most effective for targeting specific areas of the body like muscle aches and pains,\u201d explains Winter.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As promising as CBD sounds, it\u2019s no secret that this beauty ingredient is still pretty new and highly controversial, so our advice? As with any trendy, expert-approved beauty ingredient, it\u2019s always wise to consult your dermatologist before adding CBD beauty products to your regimen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n            <script>\n            $(document).ready(function () {\n                $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n            });\n            </script>\n        </p>"},

This is why cleansing with an appropriate cleanser is key to removing excess oil and keeping blemishes at bay. For existing acne, use an acne spot treatment on affected areas to reduce inflammation\u00a0and avoid potential scarring, which could remain\u00a0visible on skin years after acne has resolved. It\u2019s also important to protect your skin from the sun because this is the time when you get the most sun exposure. Severe sunburn\u00a0before the age of 18 also increases\u00a0your\u00a0risk of having skin cancer in the future. Since skin is oilier and more prone to breakouts during puberty, opt for an oil-free sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Cleanse:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_LHA+Cleanser+Gel_29854.htm\">SkinCeuticals LHA Cleanser Gel</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Tone:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Equalizing+Toner_1336.htm\">SkinCeuticals Equalizing Toner</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Moisturize:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Daily+Moisture_1453.htm\">SkinCeuticals Daily Moisture</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Protect:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Physical+Matte+UV+Defense+SPF+50_63033.htm\">SkinCeuticals Physical Matte UV Defense SPF 50</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Nice to Have:</strong></span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although moisturizers with anti-aging benefits are not necessary in your\u00a020s, it\u2019s important to keep your skin properly hydrated and moisturized at this age, so a good moisturizer is a must even if you have oily skin.

Pigmentary concerns also begin to onset around age 30, caused by damages incurred when you were in your 20s. Aside from adding an advanced pigment corrector, consider including a potent exfoliant to your routine, as well as a lightly tinted sunscreen to help correct and protect your skin at the same time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Prevent (AM):</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_C+E+Ferulic_5230.htm\">SkinCeuticals\u00a0C E Ferulic</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As cellular turnover and collagen production continue to slow down, you\u2019ll start to see\u00a0more signs of age.

This lipid loss compromises skin\u2019s natural protective barrier, resulting in visible signs of accelerated aging. To make matters worse, skin loses its ability to effectively self-repair. At this time, it\u2019s important to remain diligent with the skin care routine you\u2019ve built in your 40s, and\u00a0at the same time, be mindful of pigmentation disorders that might become more apparent in your 50s.

While there are tons of products on the market that work efficiently to clear your skin, some acne-prone folks are still left with other issues like redness and irritation. And among those acne-fighting products, very few are classified as \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201corganic\u201d\u2014which for some people matters.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eminence+Organic+Skin+Care_500221.htm\">Eminence Organic Skin Care</a>. The skin care company famously known for being natural before it was a trend has released their <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Acne+Advanced+3Step+Treatment+System_77846.htm\">Acne Advanced Collection</a>, a three-step system that not only targets and prevents moderate-to-severe acne but also addresses other skin issues associated with acne, such as excess oil and shine, inflammation, hyperpigmentation and scarring. These organic, non-irritating formulas offer a more natural approach to acne treatment, delivering a healthier, clearer complexion without exposing your skin to harsh chemicals and potential irritants.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While each product in Eminence\u2019s Acne Advance Collection has its own unique formulas, they all include salicylic acid, a potent type of beta hydroxy acid (BHA), one of the most effective ingredients for treating and preventing acne. In addition to sloughing off dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, oil-soluble salicylic acid deeply penetrates pores to dissolve excess oil, makeup and dirt buildup, clearing out congestion and blackheads.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s been proven that salicylic acid is effective at treating acne, this BHA can also be potentially irritating to some skin types, causing dryness, redness and itchiness. This is why Eminence\u2019s version of salicylic acid\u2014naturally sourced from willow bark extract\u2014is encapsulated in plant-based lipids and time-released so it\u2019s evenly deposited on the deeper layer of the skin. By allowing the salicylic acid to slowly exfoliate the skin over time, irritation is minimized, making this an ideal treatment for any skin type, even for those with easily irritated skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from salicylic acid, each product in the collection features a blend of botanical and natural actives to help cleanse, treat and moisturize acne-prone skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Acne Advanced collection features three at-home products\u2014Cleansing Foam, Clarifying Masque and Clarifying Hydrator\u2014that work together to combat existing acne and prevent future breakouts. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the products in this collection:</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What it is:</strong> A unique liquid-to-foam cleanser that gently soothes and tones.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What else you need to know:</strong> As encapsulated salicylic acid works to unclog your pores, this unique liquid-to-foam formula also has a natural blend of herbs and caffeine to balance out uneven skin tones. In addition, panthenol (A provitamin b5) contains antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties to shield the skin from irritation. The result is clean, refreshed skin without having it feeling over-drying.</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What it is: </strong>A 2-in-1 mask and spot treatment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What else you need to know:\u00a0</strong>Used as a weekly mask for a daily spot treatment, this 2-in-1 product successfully treats active acne, while preventing future breakouts as well. It\u2019s formulated with three different types of purifying clay to absorb excess oil and other impurities, leaving your skin looking matte and refreshed. In addition, the anti-inflammatory properties found in basil oil and sulfur clean and exfoliate the skin to reduce any acne spots and enhance your complexion.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What it is: </strong>An ultra-lightweight mattifying lotion.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What else you need to know:\u00a0</strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This moisturizer targets all issues that come with acne-prone skin including excessive shine, hyperpigmentation and scarring. Aside from the salicylic acid, three ingredients are at play:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Lotus oil:</strong> Made from a blend of sacred lotus and blue lotus extracts controls sebum production\u2014removing any excess oil and imperfections.<br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Zinc Hyaluronate:</strong> A type of hyaluronic acid that deeply moisturizes your skin while working to heal any acne-related inflammation.<br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Arbutin:</strong> A plant-derived antioxidant that targets and prevents hyperpigmentation and scarring.</span></p>"},

Korean skin care is known for its groundbreaking formulations, surprising ingredients and flatlay-ready packaging. It got us obsessed with sheet masks, introduced us to bee venom and snail mucin and even prompted us to google words like \u201c<em>chok-chok</em>,\u201d \u201campoule\u201d and \u201cessence.\u201d And thanks to makeup artist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BafliPWlXpZ/?taken-by=elliejellyb3an\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ellie Choi</a>\u2019s now-viral skin care routine\u2014and accompanying selfie showcasing her impeccably smooth, translucent skin\u2014another term has been added to the ever-expanding K-beauty lexicon: glass skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cGlass skin is a term for exceptionally smooth, even-toned and lustrous skin that\u2019s so flawless it has the appearance of glass,\u201d says skin care blogger and K-beauty expert <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fiddysnails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jude Chao</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a clear and elegant way of describing a certain type of enviable complexion,\u201d she adds. Like its predecessors \u201choney\u201d and \u201cdewy\u201d skin, glass skin aims for an intensely moisturized skin that gives off an almost transparent complexion and a \u201cvery youthful, lit-from-within glow,\u201d adds K-beauty and skin care blogger <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sheryllrenata/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sheryll Donerson</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While some skin care trends are focused on particular products that promise instant visible results, achieving glass skin requires a multi-dimensional approach, says Chao. \u201cThe surface of the skin must be extremely smooth, without bumps or rough texture. Directly beneath the surface, there should be a large amount of water in order to create the moist and lustrous appearance that catches and reflects light. Finally, the skin should look plump and firm,\u201d Chao explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Achieving this coveted dream-like visage requires \u201ca consistent skin care routine consisting of a cleanser, toner, serum, exfoliator and a hydrating moisturizer,\u201d says Donerson. And because intense hydration lies at the core of a glass skin regimen, Chao recommends opting for \u201cwatery products with humectants like hyaluronic acid and glycerin and considering using either multiple layers of one hydrating product or several layers of different ones,\u201d she explains. K-beauty staples like toners, essences and sheet masks are the most effective hydrators, according to Chao.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Below is a step-by-step guide on how to achieve clear, glowing, glass-like skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Asian skin care introduced us to double cleansing, and we haven\u2019t looked back since. A clean canvass is a must when it comes to your skin care routine, especially at night when your face has collected all that dirt, grease and makeup residue. Start with a cleansing oil or micellar water for your first cleanse, then follow with a gentle foam wash or cream cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Back+To+Iceland+Cleansing+Foam_76737.htm\">Thank You Farmer Back To Iceland Cleansing Foam\u00a0</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We can\u2019t talk clear and smooth skin without mentioning exfoliation. \u201cWhether using a physical exfoliator (such as crushed walnut or gentle jojoba beads) or a chemical type (like glycolic or lactic acid), this step will slough away dead skin cells that dull skin and clog pores,\u201d says beauty chemist and skin care expert David Pollock, founder of <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">JustAskDavid.com</a>. Don\u2019t overdo it, though. Two to three times weekly is ideal to avoid irritations, especially if you have sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Crystal+Deep+Peeling_66762.htm\">My Skin Mentor Dr. G Crystal Deep Peeling</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Traditional toners are often ignored because some find them to be too drying, but in Korean skin care, they take on an entirely different role. K-beauty toners are formulated with refreshing and moisture-enhancing ingredients (like green tea, galactomyces, ginseng and floral water) and are applied not only to restore the skin\u2019s pH levels but also to provide base hydration and allow better absorption of oncoming products. \u201cLayering is key here to achieving the extremely hydrated skin that\u2019s necessary for glass skin, so the 7 Skin Method\u2014applying up to seven layers of toner to your skin\u2014in general, works well for this,\u201d explains Chao.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Supple+Preparation+Facial+Toner_77017.htm\">Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Essences, the less-concentrated relatives of serums, tend to be more lightweight and watery in consistency (a cross between serums and toners). Like targeted treatments, they\u2019re formulated to address skin concerns like pigmentation and redness but with the added purpose of delivering mega moisture and hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Advanced+Snail+96+Mucin+Power+Essence_76764.htm\">COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Korean counterpart of serums, ampoules typically contain a higher concentration of multitasking active ingredients. \u201c[These] concentrated actives help nourish the skin, reverse signs of aging and promote collagen to help provide firmness, minimize pores and even out skin tone,\u201d explains Pollock. Some ampoules are only meant to be used over a certain period of time (to target skin emergencies), so for daily use, switch to a hydrating serum with moisture-boosting ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a>, ceramides and vitamin E. \u201cFor structural firmness, vitamin C and retinoids will encourage collagen production most effectively,\u201d adds Chao.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_True+Water+Deep+Serum_76733.htm\">Thank You Farmer True Water Deep Serum</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisturizing is a no-brainer in any skin care routine, but when you\u2019re aiming for that luminescent look, you\u2019ll want to reach for one that is lightweight yet packs maximum moisture. Look for nourishing botanical extracts, powerful hydrators and antioxidants. Cica, which is short for centella asiatica or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-gotu-kola/\">gotu kola</a>, is a sought-after ingredient in Korean skin care because of its healing, anti-aging and barrier-restoring properties.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Oil+Free+Ultra+Moisturizing+Lotion_76752.htm\">COSRX Oil Free Ultra Moisturizing Lotion</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You can\u2019t make glass skin happen if you\u2019re rocking dry patches and bags under your eyes. Pollock recommends adding an eye cream or serum to nourish the fragile eye area that tends to be drier than the rest of your face (and that regular moisturizers may not be able to fully quench.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Miracle+Age+Repair+Eye+Cream_76732.htm\">Thank You Farmer Miracle Age Repair Eye Cream</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">K-beauty has given us some of the best skin care tips and tricks, but masks are arguably the ones the beauty world is most obsessed with. They also happen to be the easiest way to soothe tired skin, repair damage and lock in and replenish moisture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_3Step+Aqua+Super+Fine+Mask_76876.htm\">Skinesque 3-Step Aqua Super Fine Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those #glassskin photos on your feed may be all the motivation you need to hop on this K-beauty trend, but it\u2019s important to remember that there is no shortcut to achieving flawless, ethereal-looking skin. And if there\u2019s one thing that Korean skin care has taught us, it\u2019s that great skin goes beyond cult products or buzzworthy trends: It requires consistency and commitment to your skin care regimen. \u201cSo many times, we want to rush from product to product, but I really think the skin benefits [more] from longer-term use of a few items like a hydrating toner or essence and a really good moisturizer,\u201d says Donerson, adding that sleep, diet and exercise also play a huge role in your skin\u2019s health.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And while there is definitely no harm in trying out trends and discovering what works, Chao says keeping achievable goals and realistic expectations are just as important. \u201cSkin condition isn\u2019t the same thing as clothing silhouettes or makeup colors. It isn\u2019t easy to change one\u2019s skin type in the first place,\u201d says Chao. Her advice? Focus on building a solid skin care routine that will help you \u201cfeel more comfortable and happy in your own skin\u201d instead of fixating on fads or getting caught up in unattainable goals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After all, when it comes down to it, the quest for a glass-like complexion is really just another way of striving for clear, healthy and youthful-looking skin.</p>"},

And while it might not be something we do every day\u2014like cleansing and moisturizing\u2014it can be just as effective.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That said, not all face masks are the same. Some saturate your skin with moisture, some fade dark spots and brighten your skin tone, some soothe inflamed and irritated skin, while some slough off dry skin buildup for a softer, smoother-looking complexion. The latter\u2014a.k.a. exfoliating face masks\u2014offer all the benefits of your favorite face scrub, but without the abrasive rubbing and tugging that can leave micro-tears on your skin. For the right way to use exfoliating masks, plus the best ones out there, read on.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are countless benefits of exfoliating face masks. For one, they \u201cget rid of dry, flaky skin,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.drjaliman.com/debra-jaliman-md.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. \u201cPeople should exfoliate to rejuvenate and brighten the skin,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On top of that, \u201cRegular exfoliation [can] help with any sun damage or skin discoloration from the summer months.\u201d And if you\u2019re looking for a way to up the ante on your skin care routine, exfoliation might help you do so. \u201cWhen we don\u2019t exfoliate, it leaves [a layer of] dead skin on the surface [and] moisturizers don\u2019t penetrate [as] deep,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman. As a result, \u201cSkin looks rough and dull,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Incorporating an exfoliating face mask into your routine is one thing; knowing when and how to use it is another, as every skin type (and need) is different.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIf you use a lot of makeup, exfoliating at night is important to get rid of any remaining makeup that your cleanser left behind,\u201d she explains. In addition, those with dry or oily skin might benefit from exfoliating in the morning\u2014especially if they use <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-use-retinol/\">products with retinol</a> at night. \u201cExfoliating in the morning is the way to go because you don\u2019t want to exfoliate at night when using your retinol products. When someone uses retinol, the outer layer of the skin is sloughed off and the newer skin underneath is revealed. Using an exfoliating mask at the same time [might] be too harsh,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for how often you should use an exfoliating face mask? Dr. Jaliman says, \u201cOne to two times a week is fine if you are using [it] for the first time. Once you see that you have no reaction, you can use it two to three times a week,\u201d she explains. That said, Dr. Jaliman stresses how important it is to read the instructions when using these at-home beauty treatments. \u201cWearing an exfoliating mask longer than the suggested amount of time could cause irritation,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to exfoliating face masks, there are a variety of ingredients and formulas that can give you soft, glowing skin. From glycolic acid to pineapple enzyme to charcoal, take a closer look at the best exfoliating face masks, plus the ingredients that give them their exfoliation power, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong> Kaolin + <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/bentonite-clay-benefits/\">Bentonite Clay</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Clay masks might be marketed as deep-cleaning, but they\u2019re also exfoliating. \u201cKaolin clay draws out impurities from your pores,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman, while bentonite clay is \u201cbeneficial for oily skin, clogged pores or acne,\u201d she explains. Because clay can slough off pore-clogging aggressors, those with acne-prone or oily skin might benefit from adding one to their routine. As for what exfoliating clay mask to try? SkinCeuticals makes a Clarifying Clay Masque that is enriched with both kaolin and bentonite clay along with plant extracts to pull out impurities, balance oil production and gently slough off dry, dead skin cell buildup.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/charcoal-benefits-for-skin/\">Charcoal</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Charcoal is another deep-cleaning powerhouse. But did you know it can also exfoliate the complexion? \u201cActivated charcoal works like a magnet. It attracts dirt and oil to clean the skin,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman. \u201cYou can use it as an everyday cleanser, as a mask or as an exfoliator,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe charcoal eliminates excess oil that could lead to blackheads and acne.\u201d With so many uses, adding charcoal to your skin care routine can be ultra beneficial\u2014especially as far as exfoliation is concerned. To give charcoal exfoliation a try, consider Peter Thomas Roth\u2019s Irish Moor Mud. The decongesting face mask features charcoal, lactic acid, AHAs and volcanic ash to slough off environmental pollutants (along with dry skin) that can lead to clogged pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/glycolic-acid-benefits/\">Glycolic Acid</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not all exfoliants are physical\u2014some are chemical. Case in point: Glycolic acid is a star player in exfoliating face masks. Thanks to its ability to gently remove dry skin buildup, products enriched with glycolic acid can help promote healthier-looking skin with regular use. For an exfoliating face mask formulated with glycolic acid, reach for the Glycol Lactic Radiance Renewal Mask by REN. Made with renewal in mind, the luxury at-home facial helps slough off dull skin to visibly enhance brightness while evening out the skin\u2019s tone and deep cleaning for clearer, more radiant-looking skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/yogurt-skin-benefits/\">Lactic Acid</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to glycolic acid, lactic acid is another chemical exfoliant that, when added to a face mask, can promote a healthier looking complexion. \u201cLactic acid gently exfoliates to reveal smoother and more glowing skin,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman. \u201cIt also plumps the skin,\u201d she adds. And while exfoliating face masks with lactic acid are easy to come by, we recommend Eminence Organic Skin Care\u2019s Clear Skin Probiotic Masque. If you have sensitive skin, the yogurt- (lactic acid) enriched face mask gently exfoliates and soothes the complexion at the same time. On top of that, it incorporates other sensitive skin-friendly ingredients like cucumber, shea butter and marigold to cool, soothe and moisturize the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong>\u00a0Papaya Enzyme</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to exfoliating face masks, there\u2019s a lot of hype around enzymes\u2014particularly papaya and pumpkin enzymes. Like other fruits, papaya has alpha hydroxy acids (AHA) that can slough off dry, dead skin cells through chemical exfoliation. On top of that, AHAs can support the skin\u2019s natural regeneration. If that sounds too good to be true, reach for Jan Marini\u2019s Skin Zyme. The exfoliating face mask has a formula enhanced by papaya enzymes for the ultimate at-home exfoliation. With regular use, the luxury face mask cannot only help rejuvenate, but it can also fade the look of hyperpigmentation and acne, too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Key Ingredient:</strong>\u00a0Pineapple Enzyme</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Much like papaya and pumpkin,</span> pineapple enzyme is another natural exfoliating ingredient that wows. \u201cPineapple enzyme gently exfoliates the skin,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman. \u201cIn general, fruit enzymes are good [as] they naturally exfoliate the skin,\u201d she adds. With that in mind, Herbivore Botanicals formulated the Brighten Pineapple + Gemstone Mask. Enriched with both pineapple and papaya enzymes, as well as rice water, rose distillate and white tourmaline gemstone, the exfoliating face mask doesn\u2019t just lift away dry skin buildup, it rejuvenates, tones, brightens, smoothes and promotes a healthier-looking complexion overall.</p>"},

According to board-certified dermatologist and author of <em>Skin Rules: Trade Secrets from a Top New York Dermatologis</em>t, <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/face-cleansing-brushes-tools/\">cleansing device</a> is the best way to start, \u201cas it takes off more dirt, bacteria and makeup from your skin.\u201d In addition to providing the skin with a deep cleanse, cleansing brushes exfoliate the surface of the skin, leaving it looking and feeling softer and smoother, thus revealing a more clear complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_LUNA+mini_58516.htm\">FOREO LUNA\u2122 mini</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On top of cleansing your complexion with a sonic cleansing system, Dr. Jaliman suggests switching to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/9-best-face-cleansers-for-acne/\">a mild cleanser specifically designed for acne-prone skin</a>. If you are experiencing breakouts, the right face wash allows you to cleanse your complexion thoroughly without stripping the skin of its natural oils. This can often lead to an increase in oil and more breakouts. Since mild cleansers are more gentle on the skin, you can follow up your regimen with a stronger acne product that targets breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_CLENZIderm+MD+Daily+Care+Foaming+Cleanser_11543.htm\">Obagi CLENZIderm M.D. Daily Care Foaming Cleanser</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you aren\u2019t already using a toner in your morning and evening skin care routine, now is the time to start. Dr. Jaliman suggests choosing \u201ca <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-toners-oily-acne-combination-skin/\">toner with glycolic acid or salicylic acid</a> to unclog the pores for clearer skin.\u201d In addition to promoting clearer skin, toners can also balance the skin\u2019s natural pH level and soothe your complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Equalizing+Toner_1336.htm\">SkinCeuticals Equalizing Toner</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We know you\u2019ve probably been told this a thousand times, but we thought one more reminder wouldn\u2019t hurt. According to Director of Clinical Research at the Laser &amp; Skin Surgery Center of New York, Dr. Jeremy Brauer, picking, poking and popping your skin will not get you the results you\u2019re looking for. If you have a pimple that you\u2019re desperate to pop, try applying <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-get-rid-of-pimple-fast/\">a spot treatment or pimple cream</a> to the affected area instead of picking. After all, pimple creams are designed for this sort of skin care woe.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are experiencing a bout of acne, Dr.\u00a0Brauer suggests giving <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/top-10-retinol-products/\">topical retinoids</a> a try. Applying a topical retinoid made from antioxidant-rich vitamin A to your complexion as part of your nighttime routine can help to unclog follicles and, in turn, may help acne treatments work better and faster.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Age+Defense+Retinol+Complex+10_55452.htm\">SkinMedica Age Defense Retinol Complex 1.0</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to breakout-prone skin, finding a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/new-sunscreen-formulas/\">sunscreen that works with your skin type and lifestyle</a> <em>and</em> doesn\u2019t cause new blemishes is actually easier than you may think. Dr. Brauer suggests choosing the broad-spectrum kind, meaning an SPF that will protect your skin from both UVA and UVB sun rays.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:</strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Clear+BroadSpectrum+SPF+46_20567.htm\">EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">7. DO:\u00a0</span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">Use\u00a0a Clay Mask</span></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need a facial but don\u2019t have time? Dr. Jaliman suggests treating your complexion to a weekly <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-face-mask-for-clogged-pores/\">at-home clay mask facial</a>. You can use your favorite bentonite-infused face mask or create your own! To DIY your own clay mask, Dr. Jaliman suggests combining two tablespoons of all-natural calcium bentonite clay powder with one tablespoon of water and one tablespoon of honey to form a paste. Apply it onto the skin and let it work its magic for 10 to 15 minutes before rinsing off with a warm washcloth. Pat the skin dry and voil\u00e0! \u201cThis will leave your skin feeling smooth, yet hydrated,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Not a DIY-er?

But, for the sake of clear skin (and your sanity), Dr. Brauer says to make it a point to get a <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/sleep-and-skin/\">better night\u2019s sleep</a>. When you sleep, the skin works to restore itself through a process called regeneration, and lack of sleep can lead to a tired-looking complexion, dark circles, puffy under-eye bags and sometimes even breakouts. Whether this means turning your phone or TV off an hour earlier than usual, taking a relaxing bubble bath before bed or giving meditation a try, you\u2019ll be glad you did!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>For a restful sleep, try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Deep+Sleep+Pillow+Spray_67909.htm\">This Works Deep Sleep Pillow Spray</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We hate to break it to you, but your cell phone could be one of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-causes-breakouts/\">the reasons for your breakouts</a>. According to Dr. Jaliman, the bacteria on your phone will cause breakouts. Her solution? \u201cDon\u2019t rest your phone against your face, use earbuds instead!\u201d In addition to earbuds, you should also consider wiping your phone down with a disinfecting wipe or cotton pad dampened with rubbing alcohol.</p>"},

It often shows up as whiteheads, blackheads or pimples, and can appear anywhere on the face, scalp, chest and back. It is one of the most common skin problems in the U.S., affecting about\u00a025% of men and 50% of women at some point in their adult lives.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The good news is that, with the right skin care products to help control oil production, unclog pores and lighten acne scarring, anyone can have clearer skin. Here we break down what\u2019s causing it and how you can prevent it, as well as giving you tips on how to pick the right skin care and makeup products for your acne-prone skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our teenage years may be far behind us, but clearly that\u2019s no reason for acne to leave us alone. Sure, there are a plethora of treatments, pills, creams and the like out there, but how do we know which one will work for us? To help us understand acne better\u2014and the treatments available for us\u2014we reached out to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Obagi_100108.htm?\">the experts at Obagi,</a>\u00a0the world leader in prescription-strength skin care formulas and treatments. From what triggers acne breakouts to what we can do about them, here are Obagi\u2019s best tips, tricks and product recommendations for banishing blemishes for good.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the International Dermal Institute, clinical studies show that between\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermalinstitute.com/us/library/13_article_Why_is_Adult_Acne_on_the_Rise_.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">40 and 55 percent</a>\u00a0of the adult population are diagnosed with low-grade, persistent acne and/or oily skin at some point. Thankfully, treatments are readily available. The hardest part may be identifying the types of products and medications that work best for your skin. To help, we\u2019ve enlisted top dermatologists to put together a guide to common types of acne and the best options for treatment. Clear skin, here you come.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re suffering from breakouts, the cause of your acne could be more than skin deep. In fact, according to Chinese medicine, the\u00a0complexion may provide insight into a person\u2019s internal health, with the different areas of the face corresponding to specific organs and functions of the body\u2014a system referred to as face mapping.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You\u2019ve used every\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Acne_400072.htm\">acne treatment</a>\u00a0that promises to clear your skin\u2014even avoided food choices with questionable reputations like pizza and chocolate\u2014and yet, your acne keeps showing up in the worst of times (the night before your first date or a big presentation!).\u00a0It turns out that there are quite a few other things\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_5-Surprising-Causes-of-Acne-Breakouts-in-Adults_1923.htm\">contributing to acne</a>\u00a0that you probably aren\u2019t aware of. Read on to discover 10 things that could be causing and aggravating your breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/obagi-answers-acne-questions/\">Acne</a>\u00a0isn\u2019t just a problem for teens. According to studies, those pesky zits and pimples\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17945383\">can pop up at any age</a>. Whether it\u2019s your diet, environment or stress that\u2019s to blame, you don\u2019t have to suffer helplessly. To get the skinny on acne, we talked to board-certified dermatologist Cynthia Bailey, M.D., president and CEO of Advanced Skin Care and Dermatology Physicians, Inc. and founder of\u00a0<a href=\"http://drbaileyskincare.com/\">DrBaileySkinCare.com</a>. Here, she shares her best tips on how to choose the right acne cleanser for you, as well as how to use it to get the best results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a perfect world, no day would ever have to be ruined by a breakout. Unfortunately, the world is neither perfect nor free of acne-causing bacteria, so we turn to science to help us achieve clear and blemish-free skin instead. One of the most common ingredients in anti-acne skin care products is benzoyl peroxide, often found in cleansers, toners and treatment gels. Many swear by its effectiveness, but what some may not know is how it works exactly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It happens to the best of us. No matter how diligently you abide by your daily skin care regimen or lead a healthy lifestyle, we still get that unwelcome surprise courtesy of a pimple that seems to come out of nowhere. Perhaps you had a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/signs-and-symptoms-of-stress/\">stressful week at work</a>, have been clocking in\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/lack-of-sleep-and-skin/\">less sleep than usual</a>\u00a0or are experiencing a reaction from that new serum that is all the rage on Instagram\u2014but whatever the cause, waking up to find an angry zit is enough to send anyone into panic mode. So how do you deal with it?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s safe to say that regardless of the season, there\u2019s just no room for body acne (aka bacne) in your life. Not only does it put a damper on your plans for back-baring #ootds, it can also cause great physical discomfort. Not to mention, it can be particularly frustrating to treat especially when it sprouts in hard-to-reach places. And with beach season in full swing, even the clearest and most radiant of skins are not spared\u2014thanks to all that sweating, product buildup and constant exposure to environmental irritants (and bacteria).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because acne is so common\u2014<a href=\"https://www.aad.org/media/stats/conditions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">affecting up to 50 million Americans annually</a>\u2014and often a challenge to treat, it has spawned a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_Natural-Acne-Fighting-Myths%3A-When-DIY-Could-Lead-You-Astray_1924.htm\">plethora of remedies</a>\u00a0that range from eyebrow-raising home cures (uh, toothpaste as spot treatment, anyone?) to professional prescriptions. But with the ever-growing green trend, more and more people are skipping synthetic chemicals and embracing natural ingredients\u2014as evidenced by toners, cleansers and spot treatments that feature tea tree oil, charcoal and green tea, among others. But the question really is, are natural acne fixes just as effective?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately for many, acne continues far into our adult decades, and while\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/cosmetics-cop-paula-begoun-debunks-beauty-myths/\">makeup itself doesn\u2019t necessarily cause acne</a>, it can make it worse.\u00a0That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to be mindful of what ingredients are lurking, not just in your go-to moisturizers and cleansers, but also in your makeup bag. Though there are a variety of factors that could be irritating your T-zone,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hormones-acne-aging/\">from fluctuating hormones to stress</a>, sometimes the wrong product cocktail on your skin can be to blame. Here are a few tips on how to protect yourself from unfortunate (and let\u2019s face it: annoying!) breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Life with acne can be unpredictable, frustrating and embarrassing. Whether it\u2019s the occasional breakouts or the stuff of teenage nightmares persisting through adulthood, it can be a struggle to eat right and find skin care products that won\u2019t aggravate your skin. Not to mention, the seemingly impossible task of finding the\u00a0<em>right\u00a0</em>foundation that will cover up those blemishes without prompting your skin to go haywire.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re someone with oily, acne-prone or combination skin, toner should most certainly be a staple in your skin care regimen. You might experience oiliness only in certain areas of your face, namely your T-zone, and toner makes it easy to address these areas without drying out other areas that are less oily and not in need of stripping.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p>"},

You read that right. For more than 25 years, EltaMD has channeled all its efforts and resources into catering to the needs of the most severe skin conditions. This is why it\u2019s imperative that the brand sets a high bar for itself, using only the most premium-grade ingredients that even the most sensitive skin can tolerate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that that the brand is more widely available (on Dermstore, of course\u2014you\u2019re welcome!), anyone\u2014especially those with compromised and easily irritated skin\u2014can reap the benefits of the extensive research and care that EltaMD pours into its formulas. But what does it really take to keep such a well-respected brand like EltaMD to remain competitive in the skin care space? And with everything we now know about sunscreen and its potential effects on the environment, how is EltaMD responding and continuing to evolve? Here to answer our burning questions is EltaMD\u2019s general manager, Larry MacPhee.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Larry MacPhee:</strong> EltaMD began as an offshoot of a skin and wound care product line called Elta. We refer to it as Elta Medical to help clarify the distinction between Elta and EltaMD. Elta Medical line was sold into medical distribution and ultimately into hospitals, long-term care and burn centers. We saw an opportunity in the physician-dispensed channel, with what is commonly known as cosmeceuticals, to take some of this medical technology from our success in skin and wound care and apply it to the physician-dispensed channel. We felt most of the companies at that time overcharged physicians exorbitant amounts for their product and didn\u2019t provide samples or much physician-level support, so we felt our business model would be somewhat unique, which is to offer a high-quality medically oriented product at a very reasonable price sold to physicians.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Well, some of what makes us unique is our formulations. They all have a basis in zinc as the primary UV protectant. We believe very strongly in the use of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-zinc-oxide-sunscreen/\">zinc because it\u2019s a physical sunscreen blocker</a>, so not being a chemical, the product won\u2019t erode due to exposure to UV light. Zinc, in many instances, is used for skin care treatments and is good for damaged or sensitive skin, unlike many chemical UV blockers that can be sensitizing to skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other thing we learned from research is that it\u2019s very important for a sunscreen to be cosmetically elegant. Cosmetic elegance underscores our products so that they are relatively easy to rub in. Even when formulated with titanium or other UV ingredients, they are able to rub completely into virtually any skin type. This allows a protectant that is as powerful as zinc to be used by anyone. A physical basis to our product and a cosmetic elegance to its application were two of the core components we used in the construction of all of our sun care products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We had EltaMD really configure sunscreens across three primary parameters:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The first one, of course, is skin type. Do you suffer from acne or do you have rosacea or eczema? Skin concerns and skin type are very important considerations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A second one is lifestyle: if you\u2019re outside all day working or if you like to play sports, live by the ocean or just like to go swimming. These lifestyle choices direct the kind of sunscreen that you should be using.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finally, it\u2019s geography. If you live in the mountains of Colorado, where your sun exposure is high because you\u2019re a mile up in the sky and the amount of sun you would receive there exceeds the amount of sun received in Florida, for example.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using these three parameters is one way to select which sunscreen is right for you at different times. We always suggest that you consult your dermatologist and they will be able to steer you in the right direction as well. This may be the time to point out that we\u2019re in the business of making sunscreens to give people a choice that fits their environments and protect them from skin cancer that no one wants, and if someone chooses a different sunscreen to accomplish that, it\u2019s OK\u2014just use one every day!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two things: First is that the ingredient octinoxate is not just in sunscreens, it\u2019s in virtually 60 to 70% of cosmetics. It\u2019s not just used as a UV protectant. It\u2019s a wonderful ingredient to mix products with especially if you want to obtain any kind of a UV rating or UV protection out of the product you would build. We have looked high and low and found no clinical evidence that octinoxate does any damage to the coral reef. The most recent study, which was done by a PhD out of Australia, supports that as well.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oxybenzone is a different matter, and while I\u2019ve not seen specific research that proves that it damages the coral reef, it is a benzone, which is a fairly harsh chemical. We\u2019ve never used and we don\u2019t use oxybenzone in our products. It can cause skin irritation so we\u2019ve avoided it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, the fact is that this is the legislation now (and we follow the FDA\u2019s guidelines to the letter in terms of what we do with our testing and everything else). If the state of Hawaii has exempted these ingredients from sale in their state, then we abide by that. In our collection of sunscreens, we have four all-physical sunscreens that are just zinc- and titanium-based that are easily applicable for use in Hawaii. We\u2019re also in the process of reformulating a couple of sunscreens to give people options that don\u2019t include these ingredients and will allow users of our product to still feel safe while still respecting the legislative initiative passed by the state of Hawaii.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once again I revert back to our core beliefs as a company that we apply the medical heritage of our skin care knowledge to the creation of our products. This is also true with the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/eltamd-skin-care-regimen/\">non-sun care EltaMD products</a> that we produced, with the intent to produce something that\u2019s going to help skin. We know one of the best ways skin is kept healthy is hydration. We also deliver beneficial ingredients such as peptides, enzymes and ceramides through our topical skin care products. Sometimes these molecules can get too big to move through intact skin, so we designed these products so they have the right molecular size to actually provide benefit for the user. These are the kind of things we pay attention to. We are very intent on providing high-quality products that deliver solid hydration, good skin-supporting ingredients, but we don\u2019t get too outrageous with the things that we try to claim about what products can or cannot do for everyone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Clear+BroadSpectrum+SPF+46_20567.htm\"><div class=\"col-sm-12 col-sm-6\">\r\n            <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://media.dermstore.com/catalog/500300/800x800/20567.jpg\">\r\n          </div></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I think it\u2019s a combination of some of the things I\u2019ve already spoken about with a cosmetically elegant product. UV Clear rubs in very easily and dries quickly so you can put it on, and it\u2019s not too white or heavy, and makeup can be put on over it almost instantaneously. The cosmetic elegance piece is clearly present. It\u2019s a physical-based sunscreen with primarily zinc as the protectant. It also contains <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\">niacinamide</a>\u2014which goes back to our medical heritage\u2014a vitamin B component that helps skin that is either acneic or has rosacea.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In UV Clear, we find a combination of our core beliefs and have had clients purchase with an overwhelming response. It is clearly our number-one-selling product, which suggests that the effort we put into the product and the way we designed it achieved our objective and we\u2019re very happy that it has helped people keep their skin safe from exposure to UV.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I mentioned our top product is UV Clear; our second best-selling product is <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_UV+Physical+Broad+Spectrum+SPF+41+Sunscreen++Tinted_11541.htm\">UV Physical</a>, which is an all-physical sunscreen that\u2019s tinted. We also make UV Clear in a tinted version. We tint with iron oxides, not dyes or chemicals. This helps produce an appropriate skin-tone tint and it also produces enough iron oxides to help protect to some degree against infrared (IR) radiation. All of our sunscreens contain antioxidants to help reduce the free radicals that are produced by IR, so it\u2019s that kind of efficacious performance you\u2019d want out of a sunscreen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our top-selling skin care product is the\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Foaming+Facial+Cleanser_32762.htm\">Foaming Facial Cleanser</a>. This is an enzyme- and amino acid\u2013based cleanser that is a light gel, rubs on and is literally self-foaming. It doesn\u2019t require any scrubbing and will foam all by itself. The benefit of this product is that when you rub it in, because it\u2019s a gel, it will penetrate the pores of the skin, and then the foaming action lifts dirt and grease out of the pores of the skin without scrubbing or rubbing too harshly. Because it\u2019s a very mild cleanser, we have men who shave with it. It\u2019s great for sensitive or compromised skin.</p>"},

Which is why we spend so much time (and money) plucking, waxing, threading and filling them in. That said, we aren\u2019t opposed to something more permanent. The only problem? Eyebrow trends (and personal preference) tend to ebb and flow. So, permanent tattooing is not an ideal option\u2014especially for those who don\u2019t want the life-long commitment. This is the reason microblading, with its low-maintenance and semi-permanent appeal, has quickly become a go-to beauty treatment for women looking to obtain perfectly shaped (and filled in) eyebrows with little to no effort. And albeit it being on the pricey side of the spectrum, this arch-perfecting procedure has received rave reviews from beauty experts and enthusiasts alike.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curious to know if microblading is right for you? We gathered everything you need to know before microblading your eyebrows, ahead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similar to getting a tattoo, microblading uses small needles to deposit pigments on your skin. \u201cMicroblading is a manual tattoo technique designed to create natural hair-like strokes,\u201d says Liz Carey, Esthetician, and owner of <a href=\"http://www.mascot-shop.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mascot Aesthetic</a>, a well-being boutique in Santa Clarita, California. \u201cWe use a series of small needles which look like a blade to deposit pigment into the upper dermis of the skin, making it a semi-permanent procedure,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe difference between microblading and traditional tattooing is generally the depth the pigment is placed in the skin,\u201d explains Carey. \u201cWhen done correctly, microblading [uses] pigments that are designed to break down over time, allowing them to completely fade away. Traditional tattooing is done using a machine [and] is generally designed to work deeper in the skin, creating a brow that will last longer over time,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Carey, \u201cThe initial appointment is generally two to two-and-a-half hours long from start to finish. The microblading process itself takes about 45 minutes to one hour.\u201d Carey\u2019s sessions all start with a discussion about expectations and desired brow look. \u201cFrom there, I create a template based on my client\u2019s facial structure and features,\u201d she notes. \u201cAt this point, my client and I will make any adjustments (if needed) and they will \u2018OK\u2019 the shape,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the initial appointment, Carey asks her clients to come back six to eight weeks later to see how the skin healed (as everyone heals differently). \u201cAt that point, we can make any adjustments needed such as color and density,\u201d she explains. \u201cThe [follow-up] appointment is generally one to one-and-a-half hours long,\u201d she confirms. On top of a follow-up session, Carey recommends an \u201cannual touch-up appointment to maintain the desired brow.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cGenerally speaking, you will have little to no discomfort but may have some redness and mild swelling after your microblading appointment. But it\u2019s generally mild enough that you won\u2019t notice it,\u201d Carey explains. \u201cMost artists use a topical numbing cream before the procedure, [so] you shouldn\u2019t feel any pain.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Carey uses a formula that is 5% Lidocaine, which is used to temporarily numb and relieve pain. She allows the cream to work its magic for about 15\u201330 minutes before she begins to microblade.\u00a0\u201cIf you experience excessive swelling, redness or discomfort, definitely contact your artist and see a physician,\u201d she advises.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s important to note that not everyone is a good candidate for microblading. \u201cWomen who are pregnant or nursing will not be good candidates,\u201d says Carey. In addition, \u201cThose undergoing chemotherapy are recommended to finish treatment as the risk of infection could be much greater,\u201d she adds. \u201cThose being treated by a physician or taking medications such as blood thinners are recommended to speak with their doctors to make sure the procedure is right for them,\u201d she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cMicroblading can definitely benefit certain skin types better than others, so it\u2019s important to do your research and find the right technique for you,\u201d explains Carey. \u201cI find that drier skin types have the best results [as they] tend to retain pigment the best and keep the crispest strokes. Oilier skin types will work, as well, but tend to heal a little softer and less crisp [possibly due to more oils in the skin],\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the top myths being circulated about microblading is that it impacts natural hair growth\u2014it doesn\u2019t. \u201cWhen done correctly, microblading shouldn\u2019t have any effect on your natural hair growth,\u201d notes Carey. \u201cHowever, it can sometimes stimulate hair growth\u2014which for most is a win-win,\u201d she adds. While the boost in hair growth might require more grooming, it can help create a fuller look.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWhen deciding on an artist or facility, it\u2019s important to do your research, [as] different states have different laws and regulations,\u201d says Carey. \u201cWhen researching an artist, there are a few other important factors to keep in mind\u2014and safety is an ultra-important one. Everything I use is \u2018one-time use\u2019 and completely disposable,\u201d explains Carey. Before booking your appointment, find out this safety-specific point to ensure a cleaner, more successful experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to credentials and cleanliness, Carey recommends asking to see an artist\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see not only before and after, but healed photos, as well,\u201d she emphasizes. Choosing a well-trained artist is not only important for safety, but also for your entire microblading experience. \u201cWhen microblading is done correctly, it is considered semi-permanent,\u201d notes Carey. \u201cWhen done properly, microblading should last anywhere from 12 to 24 months (depending on skin and lifestyle). If done incorrectly, the pigment could migrate in the skin and become more permanent,\u201d she warns. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how important it is to do your research on the artist you choose,\u201d says Carey.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s no secret that microblading is an expensive treatment. And according to Carey, the price will definitely range depending on location and demographics. \u201cI would say the general range may be $500 to $1,000,\u201d she notes. Carey recommends doing your research and investing in an artist who best suits your style. \u201cWhile I completely respect that everyone might have a different budget and some artists are more expensive than others, honestly take your time [and] save if you need to,\u201d she advises.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe first couple of days, the color is definitely noticeable, as it [is] bolder, darker and sharper. Around day four [or] five, you may start to experience some mild flaking,\u201d she notes. As for scabbing, Carey says she tries to avoid that, but it can happen as everyone heals differently. \u201cIt is very important not to pick! Picking the flakes or scabs prematurely can pull out the pigment and lead to loss of or no color in those spots,\u201d she warns. According to Carey, the healing process can take a full month, as \u201cit takes the skin about a complete 30 days to regenerate.\u201d Generally speaking, the 30-day mark is when the \u201ctrue color will show itself,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cDuring [the healing period], you should avoid working out (excessive sweat), submerging your face in any water and applying any cosmetics on the brow,\u201d says Carey. \u201cI generally advise my clients to use a little lukewarm water and a cotton round to wipe down their new brows two to three times a day,\u201d she adds. \u201cI feel this is an important step in order to keep them free and clear of any lymph fluid that may collect due to our fresh little wounds,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After wiping them down, Carey has her clients apply a barrier cream that she supplies them with. \u201cDepending on the client\u2019s skin type, it may be [applied] more or less than two times a day. Oilier skin types generally need a little less. Drier skin sometimes [requires] a little more,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the treatment, there are a few necessary lifestyle choices to avoid. \u201cFor best results, it is recommended to keep your brows out of direct sunlight or tanning beds,\u201d notes Carey. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">SPF is always recommended</a>\u2014however, keeping your brows protected will keep them looking their best even longer,\u201d she adds. On top of that, some product formulas are better left unused. \u201cRetinols and AHAs are wonderful products, but as with any product that is designed to exfoliate or speed up our cell turnover rate, it will speed up the life of your new brows if used near the area,\u201d warns Carey. \u201cAvoid using these products on the brow area for the longevity of your brows,\u201d she advises.</p>"},

Aside from being uncomfortable and itchy,\u00a0dry skin can leave you susceptible to infection (from scratching). It can also make your complexion look dull and zap your natural glow.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But that\u2019s not all. Thanks to shifting climate, the ongoing battle against indoor heat and harsh winter winds, this season has a knack for drying out\u2026well, <i>everything</i>. From your hair and skin to your lips and eyes, upping your body\u2019s moisture levels becomes of utmost importance\u2014regardless of your skin or hair type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is a guide to protect, heal and seal in crucial moisture from head to toe all throughout winter.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Commuting to and from your office is a workout routine in itself, especially if you\u2019re layering on clothes. There\u2019s nothing that feels quite as refreshing as a hot shower when you\u2019re frozen to your bones, but Dr. Prystowsky says those frequent and warm showers can be <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/winter-hair-care-tips/\">drying your hair out</a>. If you want the warmth without posing a threat to your locks, she says to rinse off with a shower cap, so your hair isn\u2019t overwashed. Ideally, she recommends using less shampoo or adding a hydrating oil to your hair care routine. \u201cDry hair can be a precursor to dry scalp, which could leave you susceptible to infection,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re frequently washing your hair or have a preexisting skin condition that can be aggravated by winter, like eczema or psoriasis, you might be more prone to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/dandruff-during-winter/\">dandruff</a> during this chilly time of year. Dr. Prystowsky says a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-shampoos-for-dry-scalp/\">hair product specifically for dry and itchy scalp</a> and a conversation with your dermatologist are your best bet. \u201cYour dermatologist will have solutions that are unique to you, but my advice, if you don\u2019t have oily hair, is to try washing your hair once to twice a week, or with less (or targeted) shampoo,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your favorite part of the winter is hitting the slopes, you likely already have a beloved <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">winter sunscreen</a> you lather on before hopping on the chairlift. But if you\u2019re not moisturizing your skin enough or over-exfoliating at night, you run the risk of super dry facial skin. Dr. Prystowsky says it\u2019s also important to cut back on abrasive exfoliators and harsh toners during the winter when your skin could be more easily irritated and suffer from dryness. Instead, she recommends <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/skin-for-all-seasons/\">shaking up your usual skin care regimen</a> and switching out your lighter moisturizer with a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-moisturizers-for-dry-skin/\">heavier cream</a> to lock in moisture throughout the day. Not only will you be free from the uncomfortable itch of dry facial skin, but your cheeks will look rejuvenated and fresh\u2014like the snow!\u2014too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though it\u2019s human instinct to lick your lips when they\u2019re chapped or cold, when you give in to this ritual you\u2019re actually making your condition worse, Dr. Prystowsky says. Wet puckers often don\u2019t stand a chance against freezing temperatures, or when your indoor heat causes your nose to become stuffy, forcing you to breathe through your mouth at night. To help <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-chapped-lips/\">treat dry, chapped lips</a>, Dr. Prystowsky says to invest in an effective lip balm that features botanical oils and emollients and doesn\u2019t have ingredients like \u201ccamphor\u201d or \u201cmenthol,\u201d both of which offer little moisture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you enjoy wintertime baths with a view of the snow trickling outside while sipping on red wine, we say go for it. But make sure you add an extra step to your beauty regimen and moisturize once the tub is drained. As Dr. Prystowsky explains, hot water whisks away your skin\u2019s natural moisture, causing dryness and irritation from your elbows to your knees. \u201cStick to a gentle cleanser and consider using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/new-body-moisturizers/\">body oil or a heavy lotion</a> immediately after your shower,\u201d she recommends.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it\u2019s smart to wash your hands after you retreat to the restroom or when you\u2019re about to eat, the combination of warm water and soap with winter weather can cause your hands to become rough and dry, according to Dr. Prystowsky. In addition to being uncomfortable under your mittens, if your skin cracks, you expose yourself to the many possible infections you can contract because your hands touch nearly everything. \u201cBe sure to use a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/hand-creams-dry-cracked-hands/\">heavy hand cream</a> or ointment every time you wash your hands to keep your hands soft and hydrated,\u201d she recommends. Even better? Consider using a rich hand cream with UV filters to avoid further damage from the sun.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ever wonder why offices tend to be overly cold in the summer and steamy in the winter? It might be an age-old question that doesn\u2019t get answered, but Dr. Prystowsky says those powerful space heaters or central systems can cause your eyes to dry out, pronto. One solution according to her is to use a warm-mist humidifier at home as this offers the dual benefit of warmth and hydration. Keeping a bottle of eye drops handy all the time works too.</p>"},

It\u2019s often confused with alpha hydroxy (AHA) and beta hydroxy acids (BHA) since they all do wonders for the skin. AHAs and BHAs exfoliate the topmost layers of your skin.\u00a0Hyaluronic acid, on the other hand, is a great pick for anyone looking for a serious boost of skin moisture, no matter your skin type. It is one of the most commonly buzzed-about beauty ingredients because of its <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">incredible ability to hold up to 1,000x its weight in water</a>. It\u2019s also something that your body makes naturally, so its chemical composition absorbs easily into your skin. That makes hyaluronic acid serums particularly amazing for dry and mature complexions or anyone who wants to plump away fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Curious? We talked to Manhattan Beach\u2013based board-certified dermatologist and Dermstore\u2019s medical director, Ashley Magovern to find out more.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To understand how hyaluronic acid works, we need to understand what it is. According to Dr. Magovern, hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan, which is technically a protein, that is found naturally in the skin. It\u2019s also found in the eyes, connective tissue and joints. \u201cThink of hyaluronic acid as a powerful hydrator. It has an amazing ability to attract and hold water in the skin, and in the rest of the body where it is found. It lubricates the joints and helps to repair damage to the body after injury,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if hyaluronic acid is already in our skin and body, why do we need to use a hyaluronic acid serum? Dr. Magovern explains: \u201cAs we age and go through life, our skin becomes increasingly dry and loses moisture. Aging skin loses its firmness, becomes less supple and often looks dehydrated. A product that contains hyaluronic acid can replenish the moisture that aging skin is lacking and improve the appearance of fine lines and make the skin looks more smooth.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dr. Magovern adds that\u00a0everyone can and should be using a product containing hyaluronic acid, regardless of age, skin type or concern. \u201cThe great thing about hyaluronic acid is that it can be used on all skin types, even sensitive and acne- and rosacea-prone patients. There is nothing better at almost instantly giving a refreshed, hydrated, smooth appearance to the skin. My patients absolutely love it.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re using a serum or a cream marketed toward plumping and hydrating, chances are you\u2019re already using a product with hyaluronic acid. However, to get the most out of this ingredient, Dr. Magovern recommends looking closely at your product\u2019s ingredient list. \u201cSome formulations claim that they contain hyaluronic acid even though the amount is very small,\u201d she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To be sure, she says to \u201clook for the ingredient \u2018sodium hyaluronate\u2019 early in the ingredient list.\u201d She adds: \u201cHyaluronic acid is a big molecule, and if not formulated well, it may just sit on the skin\u2019s surface. I would also look for other ingredients along with the hyaluronic acid. For example, look for other things like ceramides, peptides, niacinamide or other antioxidants. I also prefer products that are paraben-free, fragrance-free and propylene glycol\u2013free.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cI recommend adding it twice a day as the last treatment step in your daily routine, and using a moisturizer immediately over it,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cIf you are using it during the day, add a sunscreen as the final step. Hyaluronic acid\u00a0serums and creams act as a fantastic makeup primer after morning application, and I love the idea of allowing your skin to hydrate as you sleep.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, if you have oily skin and are\u00a0already using a moisturizer, Dr. Magovern says you may not need both a hydrating serum and a moisturizer. \u201cI enjoy layering a hyaluronic serum with my usual day and nighttime moisturizer. Those that have more oily skin may prefer the serum alone.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Adding a hyaluronic acid serum to your skin care routine is one of the best and easiest ways to boost your skin\u2019s hydration levels, especially if you\u2019re struggling with skin that often feels tight and dry. But that\u2019s not the only thing you can do to help your skin get as much moisture as it needs. Here are some more tips from Dr. Magovern:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to try this powerhouse ingredient?

Your skin needs moisture to stay smooth and supple and to maintain the barrier function of the skin, explains <a href=\"https://www.myclearskin.com/Hadley-King-MD\">Hadley King, M.D.</a>, a dermatologist at Skinney Med Spa and clinical instructor of dermatology at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. \u201cWithout an optimal barrier function your skin becomes more vulnerable to minor trauma and infections and it will take longer to heal\u2014plus, fine lines, wrinkles and sagging of the skin will show up more if the skin is dry,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the winter months, it\u2019s important to reach for skin care products that\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/your-burning-questions-about-moisturizers-answered-by-a-dermatologist/\">contain hydrating and nourishing ingredients</a>\u00a0that will work hard for your skin to fight the weather\u2019s dehydrating effects. King recommends that those with dry skin look for moisturizing creams or ointments that contain oils such as <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/olive-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">olive</a> or jojoba. \u201cShea butter also works well,\u201d she adds. \u201cOther ingredients that help soothe dry skin include lactic acid, urea, hyaluronic acid, dimethicone, glycerin, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/is-lanolin-safe/\">lanolin</a>, mineral oil and petrolatum,\u201d notes King. To best absorb all the hydration your moisturizer contains, she recommends applying immediately after washing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along with hydrating ingredients, according to celebrity facialist and founder of <a href=\"https://www.labelledayspas.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LaBelle Day Spas &amp; Salons</a>, Bella Schneider, most moisturizers contain a mixture of three groups:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to arm your skin with the protective barrier it needs to battle winter-skin woes and stay supple and moist?

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-toners-for-dry-skin/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">These Are the Best Toners to Use If You Have Dry Skin</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jane Chertoff \u00b7 November 29, 2018</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you live with dry skin, you probably stick with cream cleansers, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a> and glycerin-rich products along with oil-based moisturizers. You tend to avoid harsh soaps and alcohol-based products like the plague. Toners are another product you might also avoid for fear of further drying out, irritating or causing your skin to flake\u2014after all, toners are just made to help balance out oily skin, right? Well, that\u2019s not necessarily the case\u2014there are now toners for all skin types, including dry skin. And by avoiding them, you might be doing your dry skin a disservice.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Back in the day, alcohol-based toners were originally created to remove excess oil and tighten up the skin, explains <a href=\"https://www.bellaskininstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Guanche, M.D.</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in Calabasas, California. \u201cA\u00a0toner\u00a0is a terminology from a long time ago, sort of like tonic. It was named because the active ingredients used on the skin would give it a smooth, tight appearance, as if it was toned, like muscles,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the past, it was also used to tighten and smooth the surface appearance with astringents, so it was mostly recommended for oily and acne-prone skin,\u201d adds\u00a0Guanche.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even today, most people with dry skin still tend to associate toners with harsh astringents, so they don\u2019t use them, Guanche says. But toners have evolved over time. Today, she says a more appropriate definition of a toner is anything used to clear impurities like dirt and pollution from the skin. (Yep, these can still linger even after you\u2019ve used your cleanser.) \u201cThe\u00a0toners\u00a0of today have soothing agents to reduce redness and irritation and to hydrate and soothe dry skin,\u201d she says. \u201cHydrating and soothing\u00a0toners\u00a0still help to cleanse the skin further, but without removing the skin\u2019s natural oils.\u00a0In some cases, they can even help to alleviate dryness and flaking,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Buyer, beware. While the definition of a toner has evolved (<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-use-micellar-water/\">micellar</a> and rose water spray are two examples), some toners do still contain alcohol in high or low concentrations. You\u2019ll want to avoid those high concentrations if you have dry skin, explains <a href=\"http://montgomery-dermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erum Ilyas, M.D.</a>, a board-certified dermatologist at Montgomery Dermatology in Pennsylvania. \u201cMost toners still have a percentage of alcohol in them and people with dry or sensitive skin will feel a burn or sting when applied,\u201d she explains.\u00a0Ilyas says dry skin sufferers will want to look for a post-cleanse, leave-on product like micellar water, or chose a hydrating formula toner infused with milder ingredients like rose water or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-benefits-of-chamomile/\">chamomile</a>. \u201cThe new-generation toners may actually help people with dry or sensitive skin, depending on the ingredients,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd applying a moisturizer on top will only seal in some of these benefits,\u201d adds Ilyas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don\u2019t rule out using a toner just because you have dry skin. For dry skin, Ilyas recommends toners that contain soothing and hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, glycerin, vitamin E, chamomile and antioxidants like green tea.\u00a0Soothing ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">aloe vera</a>, fruit extracts and essential oils will offer the hydration your skin craves. Some ingredients to avoid include salicylic acid and of course high concentrations of alcohol, all of which can be further irritating and drying.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for using a toner for daily use, don\u2019t forgo the cleanser first. \u201cToners are best used post-cleanse,\u201d Ilyas says. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the best results if you use a toner after each cleanse in the morning and at night. Essentially, the toner will help replace some hydration that may have been stripped away from cleansing, if you\u2019re using a toner with a hydrating formula,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s a look at some of the best toners for dry skin and what they can do for you.</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Stone+Crop+Hydrating+Mist_8534.htm\"><div class=\"col-sm-12 col-sm-6\">\r\n            <img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"https://media.dermstore.com/catalog/500221/800x800/8534.jpg\">\r\n          </div></a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Need a bit more of that freshly cleaned feeling even after you wash your face? This organic facial mist provides that plus more, since it is also hydrating and soothing for dry skin. And if you\u2019re wondering exactly what stone crop is, imagine an environmentally friendly plant easily grown on green roofs that can moisturize, reduce hyperpigmentation and provide anti-aging benefits to your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Any time your dry skin could use a bit of a pick-me-up, spray on this moisturizing toner. It is full of soothing and hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/lavender-benefits-for-skin/\">lavender</a>\u00a0and balm mint. You\u2019ll also appreciate the cooling cucumber and arnica flower extract, an ingredient full of powerful nutrients and beneficial compounds to calm and protect your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you crave a bit of gentle exfoliation, look to this hydrating toner that\u2019s enhanced with lactic acid and AHAs. \u201cDry skin may benefit from ingredients like lactic acid that help exfoliate dead, dulling skin cells,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.discc.com/about/dr-tsippora-shainhouse/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tsippora Shainhouse, M.D.</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles. It also contains watermelon, apple and lentil fruit extracts, which are antioxidant-rich and protect skin from environmental stressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Live with sensitive skin that\u2019s also dry? You\u2019ll appreciate this hypoallergenic and water-based toner/lotion hybrid. \u201cSensitive skin, mild emollient lotion toners are best to help alleviate dry skin and flaking,\u201d Guanche notes. That\u2019s because it is formulated with limited, but antioxidant-rich, ingredients like natural silicates and thermal spring water to protect and hydrate skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you don\u2019t want to bother with cotton pads and prefer a toner you can just spritz on directly, you\u2019ll love this coconut water\u2013based facial mist. (It\u2019s also ideal for parched skin when you travel.) It contains soothing and hydrating aloe vera, plus antioxidant-rich rose extract to protect skin from free radical damage. It\u2019s also formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-witch-hazel/\">witch hazel</a>, a natural ingredient to help with occasional breakouts without further drying out your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dry skin sufferers will appreciate this toner-lotion hybrid that\u2019s rich in essential oils. Unlike a lot of toners, it is alcohol-free and contains glycerin, which is ideal for dry skin. \u201cSimilar to hyaluronic acid, glycerin can draw moisture to the outer layers of the skin,\u201d Ilyas says. And combined with calming lavender oil and lubricating <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/castor-oil-skin-benefits/\">castor oil</a>, your skin will continue to feel hydrated throughout the day, even in the winter months.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are up for trying something new when it comes to skin care, this toner made with snail secretion filtrate (a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/korean-skin-care-routine/\">K-beauty secret</a> weapon!) is for you. Don\u2019t be too freaked out\u2014<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/7-asian-skin-care-ingredients/\">snail mucin</a> can offer some impressive benefits, mainly because it is naturally rich in hyaluronic acid. \u201cMost people think hyaluronic acid is an anti-aging [ingredient], but it\u2019s actually super hydrating,\u201d Ilyas says. \u201cThey just give the appearance of anti-aging benefits when used topically by drawing moisture and holding it in the superficial layers of the skin,\u201d she explains. She recommends using this with a moisturizer for best results.</p>"},

Fortunately, there are many ways to address them, from brightening eye creams and serums to vitamin-infused concealers. The skin under your eyes is the thinnest on your entire body, so you need to be very gentle with it. Here we show you what\u2019s causing darker skin under your eyes and give you dermatologist-approved information and tips to address it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Periorbital hyperpigmentation, also known as dark circles, is a relatively common condition that many individuals face on a daily basis (no pun intended). And while it\u2019d be nice to be able to say getting enough sleep could cure all of your concerns, it\u2019s not always that easy. In fact, there is a multitude of reasons for those pesky dark circles and under-eye discoloration that are causing you grief.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While pulling an occasional all-nighter isn\u2019t so bad, constantly depriving yourself of sleep can put your body in a constant state of stress.\u00a0Sleep deprivation, according to\u00a0plastic surgeon and dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.aafprs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Mary Lynn Moran, MD</a>, causes an elevation of cortisol, the stress hormone, interfering with our bodies\u2019 ability to mend itself overnight. As the body\u2019s largest organ, skin is usually where the first signs of damage appear, and we\u2019re not just talking about dark circles and eye bags. Here are just some of the ways insufficient sleep can wreak havoc on your appearance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your eyes may be the windows to your soul, but the skin underneath them gives a clear picture of your age. This thin, delicate skin is some of the first to show signs of aging. Many assume that all skin is the same and wonder why products formulated for specific parts of the body are even necessary. But as it turns out, this area deserves special treatment to combat typical problems of\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dark+Circles_400059.htm\">dark circles</a>, wrinkles,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness+and+Dehydration_503759.htm\">dryness</a>\u00a0and swelling.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From DIY treatments that involve cold tea bags to high-tech devices that promise to erase evidence of sleep deprivation, you\u2019ll try anything to get rid of dark circles under your eyes. The good news is that even dermatologists struggle with this issue\u2014and they know a thing or two about how to deal with it. But the first step? It\u2019s understanding what causes it in the first place.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether it\u2019s offering a sneak peek into someone\u2019s soul or letting the world know you\u2019ve been spending your nights binging on Netflix instead of clocking in some quality sleep, trust the eyes to say it all. As the thinnest and most sensitive skin on your body, the area around your eyes is the first to show signs of aging and the consequences of inadequate sleep, squinting and sun damage. Needless to say, whether you\u2019re in your 20s or 50s, the skin surrounding your peepers needs an extra dose of TLC. And that\u2019s where eye creams come in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While concealer is your best bet to camouflaging their appearance, some topical vitamin treatments, a regular moisturizing routine and a healthy lifestyle may help keep fatigue,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Hyperpigmentation_400002.htm?keyword=hyperpigmentation\">hyperpigmentation\u00a0</a>and\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Dryness+and+Dehydration_503759.htm\">dry skin</a>\u00a0around the eyes at bay.

From applying sunscreen regularly to removing your eye makeup properly, here are some tips on how to help your eye creams brighten your eye area.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">True: Sometimes there just aren\u2019t enough hours in the day for a good night\u2019s sleep.

While moisturizers usually do a good job of keeping skin plump and hydrated, there are days when your skin craves some extra pampering and attention\u2014especially when <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/winter-skin-tips/\">snow season kicks in</a> and your skin gets blasted with icy cold air and indoor heating on a daily basis. And that\u2019s where serums and boosters come in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No longer as intimidating as they once were, serums have now become the weapon of choice of skin care junkies everywhere. And for good reason. These bottles of potent active ingredients are formulated to address just about every skin concern and are particularly known for their ability to deliver intense hydration. That\u2019s because serums are lighter in consistency and smaller in particle size, making them more efficient in penetrating the layers of your skin, explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.montgomery-dermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erum Ilyas, MD, MBE, FAAD</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While we typically rely on moisturizers and face oils for our daily dose of moisture, those looking for serious hydration may need to add a more targeted approach that serums and boosters offer. \u201cThe main difference is that serums penetrate deeper into the dermis,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://goldenbergdermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gary Goldenberg, MD</a>. \u201cMoisturizers, on the other hand, act more on the surface of the skin, repairing dry skin and decreasing scaling,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cFor dry skin types, especially during winter months, a serum that contains ingredients that can bind water to the skin or create a protective layer that holds water in the skin can be a noticeably helpful addition to your skin care routine,\u201d adds board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/stayskinsafe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, FAAD</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As with all things skin care, taking stock of your skin\u2019s needs and concerns is the first step in choosing the right products. So is paying close attention to the ingredients listed on the labels. While most serums contain multitasking ingredients that promote better skin health, you\u2019ll want to be on the lookout for powerful humectants\u2014ingredients that retain and draw moisture from the air and the dermis to better quench the topmost layer of the skin. \u201cThink hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/5-facts-about-argan-oil/\">argan oil</a> and ceramides,\u201d says Dr. Ilyas, adding that when it comes to consistency, water-based serums are best as they \u201ctend to spread quickly and absorb into the skin with ease.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To help you pick out the best face serum for dry skin, here are the top ingredients that deliver mega-moisture and hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Starting with a clean base is key when using any skin care product, so it\u2019s best to apply your serum <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/in-what-order-do-i-apply-my-skin-care-products-infographic/\">after gently cleansing and toning</a> your skin. \u201cA serum should be the first thing you apply. If your skin is very dry and you\u2019re looking to repair it quickly, layer a moisturizer right on top,\u201d explains Dr. Ilyas. \u201cYour moisturizer will seal it in and provide it with moisture to hold on to,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s also important to make sure your serum doesn\u2019t contain ingredients that may aggravate dry skin. Retinol and exfoliating acids, for example, are powerful anti-aging ingredients that can increase sensitivity on already parched skin, says Dr. Ilyas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to amp up your hydration game? Here are our top picks for best face serums and boosters for dry skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are plenty of great reasons this ultra-potent face serum has hundreds of five-star reviews on Dermstore. With its powerful formula that features hyaluronic acid, proxylane, licorice root and purple rice, it improves texture, restores elasticity and increases the skin\u2019s hyaluronic acid levels by 30 percent. One Dermstore shopper, who calls herself \u201ca big believer in Hyaluronic Acid Intensifier,\u201d says, \u201c[This serum] keeps my skin hydrated and balanced. I continue to get compliments on my complexion and often share this secret.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the best-reviewed serums on Dermstore, the HA5 Rejuvenating Hydrator draws its skin-restoring and hydrating powers from hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and peptides. It provides up to eight hours of continuous hydration, reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and protects skin from free radicals. No wonder one Dermstore customer says she was \u201cblown away by the results,\u201d adding, \u201cIt not only leaves my skin feeling amazing but it also works instantly. My skin is no longer dry or tight, and I get loads of compliments on how soft and dewy it appears.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s hard to top the intense hydration this serum delivers with its 75 percent hyaluronic acid formulation. Add sodium PCA, silk proteins and a mineral complex to that potent formula and you\u2019ve got yourself a skin-smoothing and hydration powerhouse. It\u2019s the \u201cbest dry skin repair,\u201d says one Dermstore customer. \u201cIn less than two weeks, my skin looks less cracked from dryness.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Infused with a potent lipidic trio, this ultra-hydrating serum restores and strengthens the skin\u2019s barrier to help seal in moisture and prevent water loss. It delivers up to 24 hours of hydration, smooths away dryness-related lines and soothes tightness and sensitivity.

You\u2019ve read all about the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">little-known benefits</a> of this powerful antioxidant and even found out that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Obagi_100108.htm\">Obagi Medical</a>, one of the most renowned professional skin care lines, offers some of the best vitamin C serums out there. Still, you find yourself confused. What is L-ascorbic acid and what do those percentages mean?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lucky for you, we\u2019re here to demystify the science behind vitamin C and Obagi\u2019s Professional-C Serum line. Here, we chatted with the experts at Obagi to answer seven of the most frequently asked questions about this line.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>Vitamin C<strong>\u00a0</strong>is essential for a\u00a0healthy body,\u00a0and therefore essential for healthy skin and hair. It\u2019s a potent antioxidant that can neutralize free radicals, such as those found in environmental pollutants and after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. A vitamin C serum can do various wonders for your skin. Among the most noticeable benefits are the following:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer: </strong>Not all forms of vitamin C are created equal, and there are many derivatives on the market. Obagi uses L-ascorbic acid because it is known to be the most bioavailable (most absorbed by your skin) and thus most efficacious form.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>There are three percentages of L-ascorbic acid available in the Obagi Professional-C product line. A higher concentration isn\u2019t necessarily better than a lower concentration; the difference is in intended use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>Obagi vitamin C should be used in the morning and/or evening after cleansing, and possibly exfoliating and toning the skin in a more comprehensive routine. Apply five to seven drops to the face, neck and chest using fingertips. Always apply Obagi vitamin C to cleansed skin before makeup and sunscreen application. Here\u2019s how to incorporate it into your skin care routine:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>Obagi recommends using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sun+Shield+Matte+Broad+Spectrum+SPF+50_31928.htm\">broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> in conjunction with a vitamin C product like the Professional-C serums because the protection from the sunscreen will work in tandem with the antioxidant benefits derived from vitamin C. Also, using a <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_ObagiC+Rx+System+CExfoliating+Day+Lotion_4053.htm\">vitamin C exfoliator</a> will help enhance the benefits by promoting deeper penetration for absorption.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If using <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_ELASTIderm+Eye+Cream_9346.htm\">ELASTIderm eye cream</a> with your L-ascorbic acid products, apply ELASTIderm to the eye area and Professional-C serum to surrounding skin for best results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, when used in combination with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Retinol+10_57525.htm\">retinol</a>, apply vitamin C in the morning and retinol at night.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>L-ascorbic acid is appropriate for all skin types. We do recommend choosing the appropriate concentration to meet your skin\u2019s specific needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our Pro-C serum 10% is designed for dry, irritated or sensitive skin, Pro-C Serum 15% is designed for combination skin/most skin types and Pro-C serum 20% is best suited for normal-to-oily skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Answer:\u00a0</strong>The shelf life of L-ascorbic acid is typically three to four months after opening, but can be shorter if exposed to light, air or heat for long periods of time. Keep the container securely closed when not in use. Storing your Obagi Professional-C Serum in a cool, dark area, such as a refrigerator (not freezer), may help to prolong its shelf life.</p>"},

From dealing with acne in your teens to stress-related breakouts, sun-damage and the first signs of aging in your adulthood, you always find yourself fighting the good fight to maintain a healthy-looking visage. While being diligent with your regimen definitely helps keep your skin\u2019s smoothness from going south, there are plenty of other factors that can make or break your skin care goals. Especially when you consider the fact that your skin takes a beating from a number of everyday stressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your skin\u2019s health is influenced by several factors\u2014including pollution, stress and sun damage\u2014that, over time, chip away at your complexion and make it more prone to roughness, wrinkles, age spots, bruises and sagging. Those who struggle with genetic conditions like eczema, ichthyosis, keratosis pilaris and psoriasis are especially susceptible to having dry and rough skin, says board-certified dermatologist\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.menkesclinic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lillian Soohoo</a>, as well as those who live in dry climates with low humidity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With older women, the chemical and hormonal changes the body undergoes due to perimenopause and menopause can contribute to an overall loss of skin smoothness. In fact, the normal aging process plays a huge role in your skin\u2019s health, says beauty chemist and skin care expert <a href=\"https://justaskdavid.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">David Pollock</a>. \u201c[As we age,] our body produces less and less of the key elements that keep us looking younger. Collagen protein provides firmness and support. Yet, by the time a woman reaches menopause, she has about 45 percent less collagen,\u201d Pollock explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The buildup of dead and keratinized skin cells and repetitive irritation also take a toll on your skin\u2019s texture and appearance, says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.bellaskininstitute.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anna Guanche</a>, who also cites lack of moisture and hydration as one of the top reasons your skin appears rough and dry.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Doctor Soohoo echoes this, and adds, \u201cThe uppermost layer of the skin is the stratum corneum, which contains dead skin cells embedded in a waxy matrix of ceramides, cholesterol and fatty acids. These important substances are all types of fats (lipids) that help keep the skin moist and maintain an effective barrier.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although it may not always be possible for adults to reclaim the firm, baby-smooth and blemish-free complexion of their youth, that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have to give up on your pursuit to age gracefully. Below, we put together a list of dermatologist-recommended tips for smoother skin from head to toe.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know junk food is bad for you, but if you need more reasons to go easy on those tasty snacks, here\u2019s a good one: Processed foods, alcohol and refined carbs contribute to the destruction of good bacteria and create an imbalance in your gut\u2019s microbiome, leading to inflammation that can also manifest in your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Instead, add more vitamins and antioxidants in your diet, in the form of berries and other bright-colored fruits and vegetables, to boost your skin\u2019s defenses against free radical damage. Fish is also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for smooth, radiant skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cVitamins A and C and zinc all play an integral role in skin repair and health,\u201d adds board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.westlakedermatology.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Heidi Prather</a>. Most fruits and vegetables contain the first two, while zinc can be found in dairy and poultry products, legumes, meat and\u2014best of all\u2014dark chocolate!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stress can wreak havoc on your skin, especially when you\u2019re not allowing your body to rest and recover from the daily grind. \u201cYour body repairs itself and recovers from daily stress while you sleep, so not getting enough quality sleep can cause premature aging of the skin,\u201d says Dr. Prather.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Doctor Guanche agrees and adds, \u201cThose with exhaustion often appear with skin that is sunken in, dry or sallow. On the other hand, those who are rested often have less scalloping under the eyes and in their tear troughs and have plump, fresh-appearing skin.\u201d Needless to say, it\u2019s time you make beauty sleep a priority. Clock in seven to eight hours of quality sleep every night to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/sleep-and-skin/\">rejuvenate your skin and your body</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So you\u2019re already eating more veggies and sleeping better, but your journey to a healthier lifestyle and smoother skin won\u2019t be complete without adding regular exercise to your routine. \u201cExercise induces more blood volume to be pumped through the vessels of the face, leading to more micronutrients and healing properties to the facial skin,\u201d says Dr. Guanche. It also helps <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/the-anti-aging-benefits-of-exercise/\">reduce inflammation</a>, regulate skin-significant hormones and prevent free radical damage. Plus, sweating is also a great way to purge pores of debris!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cCleansing and mild exfoliation can give skin a smoother, more radiant appearance by removing dead skin cells on the surface and allowing light to reflect from the skin,\u201d explains Dr. Soohoo. <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-double-cleanse/\">Double-cleansing according to your skin type</a> is a good way to make sure you remove all traces of pore-clogging dirt, grease and makeup without the risks of over-washing and drying out your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exfoliation, on the other hand, can be done either chemically or mechanically. But while scrubs and peels may already be part of your skin care routine, you may be overlooking the parts of your body that get the most wear and tear\u2014your hands and feet. Mildly abrasive scrubs with moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients can help soften and smoothen your legs and feet, which are prone to roughness, bumps and calluses. If you have sensitive skin that may be prone to micro-scarring, Dr. Guanche recommends lathering your body with a mild glycolic acid body wash with a soft puff instead.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for your pout, gently brushing your lips with warm water and a toothbrush will prevent flaking and cracked lips and remove dead skin cells. If you\u2019d like to exfoliate further, try a gentle lip scrub before putting on your hydrating lip balm or lipstick to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-get-rid-of-chapped-lips\">keep your pout kissably soft</a>. For the rest of your face, exfoliating acids like salicylic, lactic and glycolic acids are best when trying to renew the outer layers of the skin as these dissolve the glue-like substance that binds dead skin cells to the surface.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for an even deeper exfoliation, you can head to your dermatologist for any of these in-office treatments:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you have dry or oily skin, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hydrating-vs-moisturizing/\">moisturizing is important</a> to balance your skin\u2019s sebum production, prevent flaking and dry patches and replenish lost moisture. \u201cLotions and creams are oily products that can plump up some of the dead skin cells and provide a smoother-feeling texture by adding an oily layer to the surface,\u201d explains Dr. Soohoo. \u201cIt can be made much more effective by adding active ingredients to the lotion or cream. Think of the lotion or cream as the \u2018base\u2019 or vehicle for a more effective ingredient such as retinoid, growth factor, vitamin C or alpha/beta hydroxy acids.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In choosing the right ingredients, taking note of your skin type and sensitivity is key. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to know whether you\u2019ll be treating other skin conditions such as acne, brown spots and eczema before trying anything new since choosing the wrong moisturizer can make your skin worse,\u201d adds Dr. Soohoo. Your best bets\u00a0are mild hydrating powerhouses like hyaluronic acid, glycerin and ceramides. For best results, apply your lotion or moisturizer on damp skin (or within three minutes of stepping out of the shower) to trap water, then follow up with a face or body oil to seal and lock in moisture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take it from the French girls, and make water your best friend. Aside from helping to flush out toxins from your body, Dr. Guanche says, \u201cThe more water you drink, the more hydrated and plumper your cells become. The metabolic processes inside the cells can work most efficiently.\u201d Drinking at least eight to ten glasses of water and eating at least five servings of fruits or vegetables per day are what Dr. Guanche recommends \u201cto get all those micronutrients and antioxidants to maintain healthy skin. Remember to eat a rainbow\u2014apples, oranges, banana, kiwi, blueberries and grapes!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s no secret that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-sunscreens-and-spf-work/\">UV radiation is bad news for the skin</a>. In fact, most of the skin damage in older patients is caused by a lifetime of unprotected sun exposure. \u201cChronic sun damage throughout our life has a cumulative effect of destroying the collagen and elastin that make up the connective tissues of our skin,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://juvetress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hal Weitzbuch</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you\u2019re sipping a\u00a0margarita by the beach or flying off to an alpine wonderland, broad-spectrum sun protection is key. Especially when you consider the fact that up to 80 percent of UV rays can penetrate cloud cover and can pass through glass and car windows. In the winter, the sun\u2019s rays can be reflected on the snow and bounce back, hitting your skin twice.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For daily use, opt for <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">broad-spectrum SPF 30</a> to give your skin adequate defense from both UVA and UVB rays. If spending an extended time outdoors, reach for SPF 50 or higher.</p>"},

But that\u2019s about to change. With more and more people taking a more holistic approach to beauty and getting savvier and savvier with what they put inside their bodies, healthy skin\u2014and the pursuit of it\u2014will definitely take center stage in 2019. As another year makes its grand arrival, dermatologists and skin care experts have their own ideas on how skin care will evolve in the months ahead. From an investment in technology to one in supplements, here\u2019s what you can expect in 2019 to make you even more beautiful than you already are.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest makeup trends </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for 2018 is a natural look\u2014which means it only makes sense that for 2019, the whole beauty industry is going back to basics, says l</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">icensed esthetician and professional makeup artist Corey Michol Sam. In other words, taking care of our skin\u2014without complicated, multi-step routines\u2014will be a top priority. Sam predicts more brands will refocus on cleansing, toning and moisturizing above anything else. This simplified skin care approach gives users time to focus on other aspects of their lives, like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/self-care-activities/\">self-care and wellness</a>, while also allowing their pores to breathe.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter the need or question you have, there\u2019s an app for that. Now you\u2019ll likely be doing the same for your skin predicaments, according to </span><a href=\"http://www.janetprystowskymd.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">dermatologist Dr. Janet H. Prystowsky, MD, Ph.D</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. She says there are many developers trying to help people with skin problems, including the American Academy of Dermatology, who released a new tech-forward app designed to manage chronic urticaria. \u201cThe app allows people to journal and diary their hives, learn about them and discuss them with their dermatologist,\u201d she explains. If you\u2019re curious, check out the app store for your iPhone or Android and dabble into the scene. As more companies release ways to track skin progress, we\u2019ll have more information on how to tame flare-ups, breakouts and the rest of \u2019em.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or rather, people will be willing to prescribe to a higher SPF as more awareness around skin cancer heightens. Dr. Prystowsky explains that the days of tanning beds are gone, as younger generations understand the risk of unnecessary sun exposure and have access to at-home tanning products that require zero dangerous UV rays. They\u2019ll also go natural with their formulas in response to global warming. \u201cPeople will use higher-SPF sunscreens because of increasing skin cancer risk, but will avoid oxybenzone because it is bad for the environment,\u201d she explains. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you inhale and exhale, it\u2019s easy enough to know if the air you\u2019re breathing is healthy or questionable. But there is a pollution you turn to day in and day out that you don\u2019t give a second thought to. Until this year, that is. Dermatologist </span><a href=\"https://www.womensderm.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Sabrina G. Fabi, MD, FAAD</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> predicts more skin care products will target the effects of these toxic environmental factors. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere is mounting evidence to support that pollution not only increases the amount of pigmentation, redness and wrinkles one has, but also can increase bone loss,\u201d she explains. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news is there is a way to manage these downfalls, since Dr. Fabi explains that the topicals we apply on our skin, as well as the cleansers we use, can minimize the particulate matter that sits on our face and helps minimize the detrimental aging <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/effects-of-air-pollution-on-skin/\">effects of pollution on skin</a>. She suggests that using a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/antioxidants-in-skin-care/\">topical with a powerful antioxidant</a> can ward away the harmful inflammation. \u201cUsing topicals that fuel your cell\u2019s energy stores to heal and repair at night from all the insult our skin experiences during the day,\u201d she explains.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She recommends </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Lumivive+System_77934.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LUMIVIVE by SkinMedica</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sunforgettable+Brushon+Sunscreen+SPF+50_63786.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colorescience Sunforgettable Brush</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cIf you use LUMIVIVE in polluted cities like Beijing and New Delhi, you have fewer skin aging effects versus people who don\u2019t use it,\u201d she continues. \u201cAnd the brush is a mineral-based block that helps create a barrier from all sorts of light rays, and you don\u2019t ruin your makeup when you reapply your sunblock.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People have been using the natural fibers of the earth since the dawn of time, but lately, vitamins, especially the ones designed for the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/vitamins-you-need-to-take/\">skin, hair and nails</a>, have become trendier than ever. </span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/paprisarkar.md/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Papri Sarkar</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> says that thanks to more readily available research and information about how our skin is impacted by our diet, beauty supplements will see an uptick in sales in 2019. This promotes the idea of feeling gorgeous from the inside out, as people edit their diets, too. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMany will decrease sugars and dairy, and add in fish oil and vitamin B3. I think some will also add biotin and zinc,\u201d she explains.

But, as with almost any type of skin care product, you want to ensure you select a mask made with your skin type in mind, especially if you have sensitive skin. That\u2019s because certain ingredients can cause sensitivities to heighten and make skin feel inflamed and irritated. Luckily, there is a multitude of ingredients found in some of the best face masks that work well with sensitive skin (or at the very least, can go after the repercussions for a clearer, more radiant complexion).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Up ahead, we take a closer look at masking with sensitive skin, deep dive into the best face masks for this skin type, the ingredients to keep an eye on (for both positive and negative effects) and tips to make the most out of your masking experience.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Masking is an excellent way to target and treat specific skin concerns, like the side effects of sensitive skin (think: dryness, inflammation and redness), as they \u201cdeliver higher concentrations of active ingredients to balance the skin,\u201d says <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City. Because these at-home treatments focus on more specific ailments (and are chock- full of ingredients that promote skin health), they can be some of the most impactful products you use. That is especially true if you have sensitive skin, as masks can help to soothe, comfort and\u2014as a result\u2014promote a more radiant-looking complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though ingredients are an important factor when selecting a face mask to use on sensitive skin, the application should also be considered. When it comes to masking on sensitive skin, you want to first ensure that the skin is clean. \u201cUse a gentle cleanser before the mask, [as] you want to make sure any dirt, oil and makeup is off your face,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. For this, she suggests using a gentle cleanser to create a clean canvas. And following your at-home facial, \u201cYou should follow with a good moisturizer,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to prepping the skin for masking (and hydrating after the fact), there are some other important factors to consider. The removal process can require extra attention, as certain techniques might cause the skin to feel irritated. When removing your face mask, don\u2019t rub or scrub the skin. Instead, soak a washcloth in warm water and place it over your skin, then gently wipe away the formula. When your skin is clear of the mask, pat gently to dry and follow up with your moisturizing products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s always important to stay away from ingredients that don\u2019t serve your skin type. If your sensitivity is caused by dryness, Dr. Jaliman says to keep away from masks (and other products) formulated with salicylic acid. That should especially be considered if the product doesn\u2019t contain hydrating ingredients as \u201cit could dry your skin out even more,\u201d explains Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to salicylic acid, \u201cExfoliating beads might inflame the skin,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman. Because of their texture, the abrasion could rub the skin the wrong way (pun intended) and cause further irritation to occur. Dr. Jaliman also warns against masks with added scents and fragrances. \u201cThese might irritate your skin if you have sensitive or acne-prone skin,\u201d she warns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you\u2019re armored with tips and tricks for masking on sensitive skin, let\u2019s talk about the products you should try. Here at Dermstore, we love a good face mask\u2014especially ones that are gentle enough for sensitive skin. Take a look at some of our favorite masks (and ingredients) below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hyaluronic acid (HA) is one of those ingredients that can <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">benefit all skin types</a>. However, sensitive skin, in particular, can see some major ups from using the ingredient. Dr. Jaliman notes that it \u201chelps in keeping skin hydrated\u201d and as a result can soothe and comfort the skin (especially if your sensitivity is related to dry skin).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Phyto+Corrective+Masque_67769.htm\">SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What\u2019s better than a weekly treatment that soothes the skin? One that can stay on overnight! The SkinCeuticals Phyto Corrective Masque is made with hyaluronic acid and herbal extracts to deliver a cooling, nourishing sensation to the skin. And with regular use, it can help diminish redness, irritation and promote a smoother complexion.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When your skin is feeling irritated, one of the best things you can do is to reach for a face mask with anti-inflammatory ingredients. Speaking of which, marigold is one of them as it is \u201chigh in antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d explains Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Clear+Skin+Probiotic+Masque_30121.htm\">Eminence Organic Skin Care Clear Skin Probiotic Masque </a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This mask is loaded with some of the best ingredients for sensitive skin, including marigold, cucumber, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/yogurt-skin-benefits/\">yogurt</a>, shea butter and stonecrop. The cooling, soothing and nourishing effects of these ingredients, combined with the deep cleansing properties of kaolin clay make it a wonderful mask for drawing out impurities on sensitive skin types.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cucumber is an ultra-cooling ingredient that can benefit sensitive skin immensely. \u201cCucumber contains antioxidants and also promotes hydration due to its high water content,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. Some of those antioxidants include both vitamins A and C, which can also help brighten and protect against aging aggressors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Cucumber+Gel+Mask_2850.htm\">Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A cooling gel feels amazing on sensitive skin and the Peter Thomas Roth Cucumber Gel Mask has a similar effect\u2014except with more impactful ingredients like cucumber, aloe vera and bilberry extract. Upon application, the skin not only feels soothed but well-nourished and more elastic, too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin, you might have heard of thermal spring water, as it is used in many facials sprays that soothe the complexion. But, did you know you can also find it in some of the best masks for sensitive skin types? The naturally occurring water is \u201cpure and rich in minerals and helps to cool and soothe skin that is inflamed and irritated,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Soothing+Sheet+Mask+_73476.htm\">Avene Soothing Sheet Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moisture can instantly soothe and revitalize the skin and the Soothing Sheet Mask has a lot of it. Enhanced by the powers of thermal spring water, the fragrance-free sheet mask brings instant vitality to the complexion and leaves it looking and feeling more nourished and glowy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you experience psoriasis or other inflammatory conditions, Dr. Jaliman says blue tansy oil could help you with your skin care woes. \u201cBlue tansy oil is derived from a native European plant and has antibacterial and anti-fungal properties,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a great ingredient for those with sensitive skin,\u201d Jaliman adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Blue+Tansy+Mask_69219.htm\">Herbivore Botanicals Blue Tansy Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If your skin is feeling irritated, reach for the Blue Tansy Mask by Herbivore Botanicals. Rich in enzymes, white willow bark and\u2014of course\u2014blue tansy oil, the nourishing face mask was made specifically with irritated skin in mind. With the application, its cooling effects go after some of the inflammation and discomfort that comes with sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using a product formulated with aloe vera can work wonders on sensitive skin types as it is \u201canti-inflammatory, so it gets rid of redness and soothes the skin,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. Thanks to its <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">cooling and nourishing effect</a>, it can also help ward off some of the main culprits of sensitive skin, like dryness. In addition, it\u2019s an ultra-gentle ingredient, so it shouldn\u2019t cause any further irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AntiAging++Moisturizing+Organic+Sheet+Mask+Box_69985.htm\">ORGAID Anti-Aging\u00a0 Moisturizing Organic Sheet Mask Box</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sheet masks are masking made easy and this one by ORGAID is a must-try. Rich in soothing ingredients\u2014including aloe vera, witch hazel and hyaluronic acid\u2014the natural face mask is not just safe for sensitive skin, it works to comfort, nourish and protect sensitive skin from environmental aggressors, too.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mushrooms are all the rage in the world of wellness right now. And as it turns out, they also boast major skin care benefits. White mushroom extract specifically is \u201cknown to reduce skin inflammation and help with puffiness,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman. On top of that, regular incorporation of the ingredient can also help keep wrinkles at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Ultra+Comforting+Rescue+Mask_69563.htm\">REN Ultra Comforting Rescue Mask </a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This mask brings comfort to your complexion in just 10 minutes. Chock-full of sensitive skin-benefiting ingredients like white mushroom extract, shea butter, vitamin E and jojoba oil, the Ultra Comforting Rescue Mask delivers a punch of hydration to keep skin feeling moisturized and soothed with every use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Jaliman, \u201cPitera is composed of a natural ingredient that promotes the skin\u2019s natural rejuvenation process.\u201d Because of its rejuvenating properties, it can help soothe the skin and improve the look of inflammation and irritation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Facial+Treatment+Mask_76158.htm\">SK-II Facial Treatment Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sensitive skin can benefit from a boost of vitamins, minerals and amino acids found in pitera and this face mask.

Why? You have a hot second to change out of your leggings and tank into your work attire so you can make your first meeting of the morning. Balancing a jam-packed professional and personal life with a quest after health and fitness is no easy task\u2014and sometimes it requires cutting corners. While fitness professionals are definitely experts on how to build muscle, burn calories and see results, it\u2019s beauty influencers who know a thing or two about getting ready quickly\u00a0<em>and</em> beautifully. Though you do want to look your best, you also want to give your pores the<em> TLC</em> they need\u2014and demand\u2014after an intense routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From the best beauty products to use to gym tips you definitely have never thought of, steal a page out of these playbooks the next time you need to work out and skedaddle.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Have you ever forgotten to wash your face after a run and allowed the sweat to dry? Notice how hours later, if you go to wipe your cheek,\u00a0you\u2019ll see how perspiration cakes onto your skin. This can cause breakouts and irritation. That\u2019s why beauty writer and content creator <u><a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/dirtyboysgetclean\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matt Woodcox</a></u> says it\u2019s important to wash your face ASAP post-workout, even when you\u2019re in a rush.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because doing your entire face-cleansing regimen isn\u2019t always possible at the gym, he carries <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sensibio+H2O_72260.htm\">Bioderma Sensibio H20</a></u> and\u00a0<u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Sensibio+H2O+Wipes_72259.htm\">Bioderma Sensibio H20 Wipes</a></u>\u00a0in his gym bag to ensure he never has to skip this all-too-important step. \u201cI like to use the wipe first, then go in with the liquid on a cotton round just to make sure I get as much of the sweat off my face as possible before I am able to wash my face. The reason I find this effective is because it\u2019s almost like a mini post-workout double cleanse,\u201d he explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you grin-and-bear-it through a workout, your face becomes living proof of your effort. In other words, your face turns mighty red. This can be annoying when you\u2019re trying to put on makeup and head into the office. Luckily, beauty influencer <u><a href=\"http://instagram.com/aloeandglow\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jeni Steinkopf</a></u> has a solution. While her face is red and hot, she likes spraying a hydrating and cooling toner on her skin to calm it down.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cSomething as simple as <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Grape+Water_76079.htm\">Caudalie\u2019s Grape Water spray</a></u> feels amazingly refreshing after a good workout,\u201d she says. \u201cAfter cleansing, I will mist it all over my face a couple of times because it feels so good. The grape water is nourishing and moisturizing. Since it\u2019s only one ingredient, it\u2019s suitable for even sensitive skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though plenty of people have strategies for fixing their hair after a killer spin class, hair expert and entrepreneur <u><a href=\"http://www.hottiehair.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Crystal Frehner</a></u> says it\u2019s more important to game-plan before you head into the studio. To prepare for your workout\u2014and keep your hair crisp afterward\u2014she recommends using a texturizing spray and putting your hair in a braid. Not only does this save time, since you don\u2019t have time to wash your hair after, but it can also be, well, super-pretty, depending on your hair type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe texturizing spray will give your hair volume and work with the sweat to set your hair in the braid, resulting in loose, messy waves, which is super on-trend and stylish,\u201d she explains. For best results, consider adding <u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Dry+Texturizing+Spray+_77266.htm?keyword=oribe%20dry%20texturizing%20spray\">Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray</a></u> to your gym bag to try it yourself.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You know what we\u2019re talking about: that post-workout\u00a0glow. Your skin is flushed but it\u2019s radiant, with a dewy complexion and subtle shine. To keep this natural rosy glow throughout the day, makeup artist and podcast host <u><a href=\"http://www.cassandramcclure.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cassandra McClure</a></u> suggests using <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Prism+Natural+Fruit+Acids+5+Exfoliating+Glow+Potion_77091.htm\">Herbivore Prism Exfoliating Glow Potion</a> before you head out of the gym.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWe need to keep hydrated when we work out. Our skin needs the same hydration, and a few drops on skin not only hydrates, it exfoliates and won\u2019t clog my pores,\u201d she raves. \u201cThis clean beauty serum contains herbal extracts, vitamin C and aloe vera to soothe my skin, so I walk out of the gym with that fresh glow.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By \u201cbaby,\u201d we actually do mean for babies. At least, that\u2019s makeup artist Jules Annen\u2019s solution to wipe away sweat in a hurry. If you don\u2019t have time to shower right away and need to be somewhere in about 20 minutes,\u00a0<u><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Stelatopia+Wipes_76013.htm\">Mustela Stelatopia Wipes</a></u> can help get rid of sweat and debris without drying your skin. \u201cBecause these are designed for babies, they are extra absorbent, extra nourishing and great for sensitive skin,\u201d she explains.</p>"},

But because not many of us have the luxury of time and extra dough in the budget, opting for professional skin care brands is the next best thing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin care consumers are becoming savvier and demanding more from their products\u2014and, as a result, professional skin care brands are having a serious moment.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what exactly does \u201cprofessional skin care\u201d mean? What are the benefits? And is it possible to assemble a professional-level skin care routine without the professional-level price tag?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Donna Hart, MD, Board Certified Dermatologist at Texas-based </span><a href=\"https://www.westlakedermatology.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Westlake Dermatology,</span></a>\u00a0there isn\u2019t any definite set of criteria to define professional skin care lines. But in the general sense, p<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rofessional skin care refers to products formulated by brands historically sold in dermatology offices, or brands developed by dermatologists themselves.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c[These] are companies that have often devoted a lot of time researching their ingredients and their delivery vehicles to ensure the most effective delivery into their target area of skin, whether it be more superficial for pigment improvement, or deeper for things like collagen promotion or anti-inflammatory effects,\u201d says Dr. Hart.\u00a0\u201c[Professional] brands often got their start being sold in dermatologists\u2019 offices so they have been tried and tested. Therefore, you can have an increased level of efficacy and quality with these brands.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn my opinion, what defines professional-level skin care is a commitment to developing novel products with ingredients that are rigorously scientifically tested to produce specific and reproducible results,\u201d adds Dr. Margo Weishar of </span><a href=\"http://www.springhousederm.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Springhouse Dermaesthetics</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a Pennsylvania-based practice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, now that you know </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> professional skin care is, let\u2019s talk about </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can benefit from it. And the answer? Pretty much everyone.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the time and energy devoted to research, development and sourcing the highest-quality ingredients typically yield much more effective products\u2014and, with the right regimen, you can experience professional-level results you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find with drugstore products.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These products are so diverse that really most patients can benefit from professional lines,\u201d says Dr. Hart. \u201cIn particular, patients with a specific area of concern such as dry, sensitive skin, pigmentary issues or signs of photo-aging may additionally benefit from certain professional products, as many have proprietary ingredients to best target these concerns.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there\u2019s no denying that professional skin care brands are going to cost you more than something you pick up at CVS. But, like most things, you get what you pay for\u2014and the extra cost is a direct result of the extra time, energy and quality that go into professional products.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cProfessional-level product lines (or medical-grade skin care, as it is often referred to) may spend more money on developing and testing new ingredients, introducing new concepts to the public, using cosmetically elegant bases and luxury packaging. \u00a0They are \u2018smaller batch\u2019 and therefore more expensive to produce than mass-marketed products,\u201d says Weishar. \u201cThey often cost more than drugstore brands\u2014and are worth that cost when the degree of benefit is many times what a basic product can produce.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional skin care lines may be more expensive than other products\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to completely blow your budget to get great skin. Here are some tips on how to build your professional skin care routine if you\u2019re just starting out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you blow your entire paycheck on professional products, talk to your dermatologist, especially if you have sensitive skin. \u201cThese products may contain higher levels of ingredients which are not suitable to all skin types and must be recommended by professionals with a deep knowledge of all aspects of your skin, taking into account [your] specific needs, goals and challenges,\u201d says Weishar. \u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Visiting your trusted dermatologist is always a great first step, because we can often help navigate the milieu of product choices available and recommend certain ingredients to look for (or to stay away from!) in products,\u201d says Hart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional-grade products can be expensive, but you don\u2019t need them for every single product in your regimen. Professional products are great for more targeted treatments, but if you want to save some cash, it\u2019s fine to supplement them with more affordable basics.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDon\u2019t forget the basics\u2014cleanser, moisturizer and DAILY sunscreen\u2014before going on to add higher level products,\u201d says Weishar. \u201cThese are the foundation of your skin care, and it\u2019s worth seeking out the best combination of these products for everyday use before adding [more expensive] professional-level products.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to experiment with professional skin care, there\u2019s no need to go out and by the entire line. If you want to see how a professional line works for you (and not blow your budget in the process), choose one skin care concern you\u2019re struggling with and invest in one professional product to see how it reacts with your skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you are trying to build a regimen on your own, start with ONE product from ONE category and use it for several weeks\u2014both to see how you tolerate it <em>and</em> to see whether you are seeing benefits,\u201d says Weishar. \u201cMost topical products take about 12 weeks of constant use to produce results\u2014so stay with it for that amount of time to give it a chance to work.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional skin care brands are a must-try for anyone who wants to see serious results with their skin. And the best part? You can try them at any price point.\u00a0</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s take a look at professional skin care brands that will deliver transformative results for your skin\u2014no matter your budget:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since 1994, </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinCeuticals_100113.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SkinCeuticals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has been combining the most efficacious clinical ingredients with botanical extracts to create products that bridge the gap between science and nature to both treat and nourish the skin. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brand\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AntiAging+System_38328.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anti-Aging System</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014which includes </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_C+E+Ferulic_5230.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">C E Ferulic</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a vitamin C serum that firms and brightens the skin; </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Resveratrol+B+E_57836.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resveratrol B E</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a night serum rich in antioxidants; and </span><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_AGE+Interrupter_20343.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A.G.E.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-ferulic-acid/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">What Is Ferulic Acid, Plus the Best Skin Care Products That Have It</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Jessica Griffiths \u00b7 February 15, 2019</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ferulic acid might not be in your standard skin care vernacular, but antioxidants certainly are. Antioxidants are skin care superheroes; they neutralize free radicals, protecting the skin and reducing signs of aging. Simply put, they\u2019re lifesavers, and ferulic acid is one of them. With the help of Nichelle Temple, esthetician and owner of <a href=\"https://inderma.studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Inderma Studio</a> in NYC, let\u2019s explore this little-known skin care ingredient and its many benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ferulic acid, as mentioned, is an antioxidant. It\u2019s naturally found in the cell wall of plants including bran and certain fruit seeds where it helps to protect and preserve. In the world of skin care, it does just that: protects and preserves. Applied topically, ferulic acid can protect against free radicals and help with skin rejuvenation. Additionally, Temple says, it \u201cimproves signs of premature aging, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while keeping your skin strong and firm.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ferulic acid works well in tandem with other antioxidants like vitamins C and E to stabilize and promote their strengthening qualities and further protect against the harmful effects of free radicals. According to the <a href=\"https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(15)32491-X/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journal of Investigative</a> <a href=\"https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(15)32491-X/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dermatology</a>, \u201cFerulic acid alone (and vitamins C and E) provides partial protection but vitamins C, E and ferulic acid [altogether] provide virtually complete protection.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Temple says that \u201cbecause it stabilizes antioxidants such as highly oxidative vitamin C, ferulic acid actually makes other skin care ingredients last longer and work harder to fight free radicals.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you know about it, you\u2019ll see ferulic acid as an ingredient in many popular skin care products, notably serums and creams. It\u2019s often paired with vitamins C and E (we know why now). Temple notes that ferulic acid\u00a0\u201cis also found alongside vitamin B and niacinamide to keep skin looking smooth.\u201d It can also be combined with retinol for skin brightening and evening of your tone. \u201cFerulic and phloretin (a compound found naturally in apples) shield against exposure to the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays by reducing oxidative stress.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Temple suggests integrating ferulic acid into your morning routine as it \u201cwill give your skin antioxidants to battle the environmental factors during the day. When applying after your evening cleansing, the remnants of the topical antioxidants will help kickstart your morning routine.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This ingredient is also known to be safe for most skin types, unless you have sensitive skin, had a negative reaction to anything similar and/or any grain allergies.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This serum is a powerful combo of ferulic acid and pure vitamins C and E.

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-cleansing-oils/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">The Best Oil Cleansers for Your Skin Type\u2014And How to Use Them for Best Results</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Bianca Mendez \u00b7 February 19, 2019</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve been battling excess oil, clogged pores and frequent acne flare-ups for a long time, you\u2019re probably recoiling at the mere thought of cleansing your face with oil. But here\u2019s something we\u2019ve learned from skin care experts: Our skin produces oil because it needs it. It lubricates, heals and protects our skin. And each time we strip the oil away from our skin with our traditional cleansers, our skin overcompensates by producing even more oil. And we know what happens when excess oil gets mixed up with bacteria and other skin impurities\u2014our pores get all clogged and inflamed. So how do we cleanse our skin without disrupting our skin\u2019s moisture balance? Simple: We fight oil with oil!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cWater-based cleansers aren\u2019t as effective at removing oil-based debris like sebum and makeup as oil is,\u201d says cosmetic acupuncturist and herbalist <a href=\"http://www.acufunkture.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kathleen Funk</a>. \u201cOil is a gentle way to thoroughly cleanse your skin without having to scrub harshly or strip it of its natural oils. If you\u2019ve heard of the Asian ritual of <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-double-cleansing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">double cleansing</a>, cleansing with oil is actually the first step.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sandra Velandia, New York\u2013based esthetician, agrees, saying that while the idea of using oil to get rid of oil sounds counterintuitive, cleansing oils are actually a gentle and extremely effective way for deep-cleaning pores and a having a healthier lipid barrier. \u201cOil dissolves oil, so by pre-cleansing [with a cleansing oil] we are giving our pores a deeper cleanse without over-stripping the skin,\u201d she says.\u00a0\u201cChemicals in our water and the harshness of some cleansers can disrupt our skin\u2019s natural protector, sebum. Therefore, oil cleansing is a gentler and less aggressive way of getting our skin clean.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When using a cleansing oil to wash your face, start by massaging the oil onto dry skin. \u201cMake sure you are massaging until the oil gets warm,\u201d advises Velandia.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you\u2019ve loosened up the dirt, oil and makeup, simply rinse your face off with warm water. Follow this step with a water-based cleanser, if desired. Here\u2019s a quick video on how to use an oil cleanser:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A general rule of thumb when shopping for cleansing oils is that the fewer ingredients, the better, says Valendia. Also, look for one that has a high concentration of oil. Below are some of our favorite cleansing oils for each skin type.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulated with <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/olive-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">olive oil</a>, this water-soluble cleansing oil practically melts onto your skin, getting rid of every bit of makeup and residue from the day. And because olive oil is rich in\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/lipids-for-your-skin-care/\">lipids</a>, fatty acids and\u00a0vitamins A and E, this cleanser offers extra moisturizing and antioxidant benefits, too. No wonder it\u2019s one of the top-reviewed cleansers on Dermstore, with more than 500 5-star reviews!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One Dermstore shopper says it \u201cworks wonders to remove all of my makeup while still leaving my skin so soft and clean,\u201d while another says it \u201cremoves every bit of even my waterproof mascara without burning my eyes.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those with acne-prone skin might feel nervous about applying oil to their skin, but according to Velandia, cleansing oils are great for getting rid of excess sebum without leaving your skin dry. Even better: Aside from grape seed oil, this oil cleanser also features <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/charcoal-benefits-for-skin/\">charcoal</a>, which draws out and traps acne-causing bacteria from your pores.\u00a0One Dermstore shopper claims that \u201cafter using it, my skin is left hydrated, clean and clear. I think [it] is also helping with minimizing breakouts.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Similarly, if you have oily skin, you need a cleanser that can\u00a0remove just the extra shine and oil. This gentle cleansing oil will do just that, as well as help control your sebum production. Featuring three different kinds of oils\u2014black bean, black sesame seed and black currant\u2014this cleanser works to deep-clean those pores while adding a protective layer of antioxidants and moisture to prevent dehydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cDry skin types do really well with the oil-cleansing method because the oil will provide a deep-cleansing of the skin while helping to reintroduce lipids,\u201d says Velandia. Thankfully, this cleansing oil has what\u2019s called a Kefir Hydro-Complex, a combination of four strains of probiotics from kefir, which soothe skin and improve the skin\u2019s moisture barrier, plus a Ceramide Complex that promotes water retention. Once the oil meets water, it turns into a silky, milky texture that resembles a traditional facial cleanser.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Those with sensitive skin will want to consider this cleansing oil, thanks to its gentle combination of soothing and hydrating ingredients: stonecrop hydrates and calms redness while a potent blend of microgreens complex protects skin against environmental stressors.\u00a0And because it\u2019s also formulated with jojoba oil\u2014which features wax esters\u00a0and fatty acids that are similar to human sebum\u2014and vitamin-rich sunflower oil, it\u2019s mild enough to be used on even the most sensitive skin. One Dermstore shopper comments: \u201cMy skin is combo/sensitive/hormonal acne, and this product makes it feel lovely and clean!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those dealing with eczema, it can be hard to find any product gentle enough for your skin. But this cleansing oil is formulated with Av\u00e8ne\u2019s thermal spring water, which has been clinically shown to soothe sensitive and irritated skin types. One Dermstore shopper says, \u201cThis is the only cleanser that I can use head to toe that does not irritate my skin in any way, give me a rash, leave me red or make my skin itch when I get out of the shower.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cleansers rarely make an impact on the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, but this cleansing oil by Juice Beauty sure tries! Formulated with fruit stem cells and resveratrol, a powerful antioxidant, this oil gives your skin a better fighting chance against age-accelerating free radicals. Organic fruit acids help exfoliate dead skin cells and brighten skin tone, prepping your skin for the rest of your regimen. And perhaps the most important factor to consider if you have mature skin: this exfoliating cleanser doesn\u2019t leave your skin tight or dry. One Dermstore shopper says, \u201cI use it to double cleanse, and my face always feels really soft and hydrated afterwards.\u201d</p>"},

But did you know that it actually has some pretty cool health and beauty benefits? This golden-hued herb has been used for centuries in <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/ayurvedic-skin-care-tips/\">Ayurvedic medicine</a> (a system of healing medicine that has been around for more than 5,000 years), says Dr. Sharyn Laughlin, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and medical director of\u00a0<a href=\"http://laserderm.ca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Laserderm</a>\u00a0in Ottawa, Ontario. Indian brides have even reportedly been using DIY turmeric masks for years to achieve glowing skin, notes Dr. Laughlin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Turmeric contains curcumin, a type of polyphenol (a potent\u00a0antioxidant) that has anti-inflammatory properties, says\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.samanthacassetty.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Samantha Cassetty</a>, RD, a New York City\u2013based nutritionist.\u00a0Dr. Laughlin points out that doctors are now studying its use in relation to everything from gastrointestinal disorders to cancer to depression. \u201cThe polyphenol compounds within turmeric seem to exhibit efficacy in multiple pathways related to things like improving the cellular death of cancerous cells and inhibiting their migration,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A study published in the journal <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5664031/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Foods</a></em> explains that curcumin\u2019s anti-inflammatory properties aids in reducing symptoms associated with conditions including arthritis and anxiety. The study also notes that due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nature, curcumin can also boost the mood and brain function of healthy people.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cIn terms of topical use, we are starting to understand that turmeric has beneficial properties relating to its use as an anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and antioxidant,\u201d says Dr. Laughlin. \u201cIt\u2019s emerging as an innovative ingredient for improving wound healing and the benefits extend to other skin conditions like acne and eczema,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Various studies back this up. A\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27213821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2016 review</a>\u00a0found that turmeric\u2014when taken internally or applied topically\u2014may help improve skin issues ranging from acne to\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/difference-psoriasis-and-eczema/\">psoriasis</a>\u00a0to sun damage.\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.journal.nu.ac.th/index.php?journal=NUJournal&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=173&amp;path%5B%5D=179\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Another study</a>\u00a0suggests that curcumin in facial cream could help prevent the production of melanin, the pigment responsible for dark spots.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to adding spices like turmeric to your diet, Cassetty recommends using them liberally and often to help reap the antioxidant benefits. Sprinkling some into coffee or your baked goods are easy ways to hop on the turmeric train, she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But before you do, there are a few precautions to note. According to the <a href=\"https://nccih.nih.gov/health/turmeric/ataglance.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Medicine</a>, turmeric is considered safe when ingested or applied topically, but taking high doses of it may cause stomach troubles. Plus, the Center recommends consulting with your doctor before adding any herbal supplements to your routine, as supplements can sometimes interact with medications. Additionally, applying turmeric directly to your face could get messy really fast.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not a DIY-er? Spice up your beauty routine with these turmeric-infused products instead!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for a way to fade dark spots and make your skin brighter, turn your attention to this dark spot treatment. Turmeric and licorice root help lighten hyperpigmentation, punarnava curbs melanin (a.k.a. pigment) synthesis to even skin and GigaWhite\u2122 blocks melanin production. In addition to your face, you can even use this dark spot corrector on your hands and chest.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Facial oils sometimes get a bad rap, but not all of them are greasy. In fact, this one is quite the opposite. It contains turmeric for antioxidant protection and added brightness, fermented <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/olive-oil-benefits-for-skin/\">olive</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/argan-oil-benefits/\">argan oils</a> to reduce the look of fine lines, chlorophyllin-copper complex to make pores look smaller and grape seed oil to moisturize sans grease.

Enter the cleansing oil, a gentle skin care product that dissolves makeup without the need for harsh rubbing. This particular product utilizes turmeric to alleviate redness and sensitivity (often associated with inflammation), <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamin C</a> to brighten skin and provide antioxidant protection and lime pearl extract and white willow bark to gently exfoliate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most common skin care problems is hyperpigmentation, i.e. dark spots and discoloration. Many products targeted to treat this issue contain <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/what-is-hydroquinone-and-is-it-safe/\">hydroquinone</a>, a skin-brightening agent known to have some serious side effects.

Learn the inner workings of this amazing ingredient, and find out how you can leverage it to solve some of your most pressing issues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cGlycolic acid put skin care on the map in the \u201990s,\u201d says board-certified, Beverly Hills\u2013based dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.rapdermbh.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Vicki Rapaport, M.D.</a> \u201cIt was the first ingredient that was either incorporated into a take-home cream or done in a peel that actually did anything without breaking the bank or requiring anesthesia.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A derivative of sugarcane, glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), a group of naturally occurring \u201cfruit acids\u201d that can be found in foods. AHAs work by loosening the glue-like substance that holds dull and dead skin cells on the topmost layer of your skin, revealing newer, healthier skin. It also stimulates new cell generation, resulting in improved skin texture, tone and a brighter complexion.\u00a0And because glycolic acid has the smallest molecular size of all the AHAs, it\u2019s the most bioavailable and active, allowing it to penetrate the skin the most easily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But that\u2019s not all. Aside from providing instant rejuvenation, glycolic acid has also been shown to stimulate the production of collagen and elastin, which means that with continuous use, glycolic acid can actually accelerate skin healing and reduce signs of environmental damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some dermatologists also favor glycolic acid over other acids to improve skin issues like blackheads, hyperpigmentation, enlarged pores, psoriasis, keratosis pilaris and hyperkeratosis, among others. It also removes excess oil, just as it relieves dry and scaly skin conditions. \u201cIn my experience,\u201d says dermatologist Dr. Michelle Henry, \u201cI find it to be more effective and with fewer side effects than other acid.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now that you know how glycolic acid works, the next step is to find a way to make glycolic acid work for you. Of course, nothing beats a visit to your dermatologist or esthetician\u2019s office for a series of professional peels, but maintenance at home is crucial!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n                    <script>\n                        $(document).ready(function () {\n                            $('.forSeo img').attr('itemprop', 'image');\n                        });\n                    </script>\n                </p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why we love it:</strong>\u00a0Aside from the fact that it\u2019s from a dermatologist-recommended brand?

{"url": "https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-does-collagen-do/", "title": "<h1 class=\"postTitle\" itemprop=\"headline\">What Does Collagen Do? (Plus, 7 Collagen-Boosting Products Your Skin Will Love)</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Janeca Racho \u00b7 March 1, 2019</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These days, you can\u2019t navigate the beauty aisle without seeing the word \u201ccollagen\u201d brandished in just about every product imaginable. From serums to sheet masks, each product claims to either preserve, boost or restore its production. But before you dismiss this collagen craze as just another beauty fad, let\u2019s take a look at what it is exactly and why we need so much of it in the first place.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Collagens are a protein peptide that comprises 30 percent of our body\u2019s total protein mass\u2014making them the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3003457/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most abundant protein in</a>\u00a0mammals. \u201cIt\u2019s the structural protein of the body and the stress-resistant material of the skin,\u201d says Dr. Maral K. Skelsey, MD, director of the\u00a0<a href=\"http://mohs-md.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dermatologic Surgery Center</a>\u00a0and clinical associate professor of Dermatology at Georgetown University. \u201cFound in the skin as well as tendons, cartilage, ligaments and linings of bones and blood vessels, it allows the body and the skin to retain its shape and resist tearing and deformation,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of its fibrous nature, collagen is often referred to as the body\u2019s \u201cscaffolding,\u201d supporting and connecting tissues and internal organs. Think of it as the glue that holds everything together. There are 28 types of collagen, with\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21582/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Type I, II and III being the most common</a>\u00a0(constituting 80 to 90 percent of our body\u2019s collagen supply).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Among other things, collagen is responsible for keeping skin firm, supple and smooth. Research shows that ingesting collagen can improve the overall look and feel of skin. A study published in the journal <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23949208\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Skin Pharmacology and Physiology</a></em> found that women who took a collagen supplement once a day had marked improvements in skin elasticity after a month\u2019s time. The women also showed higher levels of hydration in the skin at the end of the study.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Collagen also improves elasticity, which reduces the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite. A study published in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5057295/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology</a></em> states that while nothing can get rid of stretch marks altogether, collagen injections are one treatment that can help prevent new stretch marks from forming and fade existing ones. This study also explains that topical skin care treatments that increase collagen production can help diminish the appearance of stretch marks as well.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to collagen\u2019s ability to reduce the look of cellulite, a study published in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685482/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journal of Medicinal Foods</a></em> found that women who took collagen supplements for six months showed an improvement in the appearance of their moderate cellulite at the end of the study. (Like stretch marks, there\u2019s nothing that can totally remove cellulite.)\u00a0 The study authors explain that collagen is able to restore \u201cdermal structure,\u201d which is what gives it the ability to smooth the look of cellulite.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, our body inevitably loses collagen over time. Starting in our 20s, its production goes down by 1 percent each year. \u201cCollagen fibers are degraded by enzymes and synthesis can be diminished by UV exposure from the sun, which can lead to photoaging or wrinkling,\u201d explains Dr. Skelsey. The breaking down of collagen is also further affected by other factors such as pollution, smoking, alcohol and stress.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But all is not lost. According to Dr. Harry Glassman of\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinClinical_503524.htm\">SkinClinical</a>, \u201cCollagen production can be increased by improving the metabolism of the skin.\u201d Laser and ultrasound procedures can help encourage the production of collagen, with topical retinoid and retinol being alternatives to in-office procedures. Collagen supplements\u2014particularly those with collagen-boosting ingredients like vitamin C, zinc and hyaluronic acid\u2014and a healthy diet and lifestyle, can also help prevent the destruction of collagen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the never-ending quest for healthier skin, knowing is indeed half the battle. The other half? Finding the right products to give your skin its much-needed collagen boost. Below are our top picks!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the best types of anti-aging products you can use: serum. Due to its super-lightweight texture, serums have the ability to penetrate deeper into the skin than a moisturizer, making it quite an effective option. This serum relies on two types of collagen\u2014marine collagen and hydrolyzed collagen\u2014to do its job of firming skin and smoothing out wrinkles. It\u2019s also formulated with glycine, alanine and proline (amino acids) to support healthy collagen production.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Oftentimes anti-wrinkle creams are very heavy, but this gel cream version has a lightweight texture that sinks into skin almost immediately. It\u2019s formulated with the brand\u2019s \u201cproteoglycan-derma complex,\u201d which spurs collagen production and bumps up <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a>, an ingredient that smooths wrinkles and deeply moisturizes skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who knew seaweed could have such <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/seaweed-benefits-skin/\">major skin benefits</a>? The winged kelp (a type of seaweed) in this anti-aging has a slew of skin care benefits\u2014it promotes collagen production, hydrates and improves both texture and tone. Hello, smoother skin!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond targeting wrinkles, an effective anti-aging skin care product will also successfully brighten your complexion and defend your skin against oxidative stress (like pollution). This gel-cream fits the bill. Collagen and elastin in the formula make skin firmer, while hyaluronic acid balances moisture and Astaxanthin, an antioxidant that\u2019s more powerful than vitamin C, protects skin against the elements.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to anti-aging skin care, don\u2019t forget about your neck. While you diligently slather lotions and potions on your face, what you do to your neck is just as important. Enter these gel pads, which are chock full of anti-aging ingredients like plant collagen and niacinamide to minimize the look of wrinkles and hyperpigmentation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Taking care of your skin from the inside out is just as important as what you put on your face. With that being said, a collagen supplement is a great way to address signs of aging. This daily supplement contains types I, II and III of collagen, along with vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, red wine extract (an antioxidant) and grape seed extract (a nourishing ingredient) for better skin elasticity, improved firmness, antioxidant protection and increased levels of hydration.</p>"},

In my opinion, everyone should be applying vitamin C to the skin as part of a daily regimen,\u201d she says. \u201cA good topical regimen is highly underrated; it can make a remarkable difference in the skin over time. My patients are often astounded by the difference they see in their skin with just adding a vitamin C serum.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C is essential for many cellular and skin functions, according to Dr. Magovern, including collagen synthesis, maintaining skin strength and integrity, wound healing and free radical and UV protection. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/antioxidants-in-skin-care/\">Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant</a> that is naturally and normally found in the skin in high concentrations,\u201d she explains. \u201cAs an antioxidant, it oxidizes (neutralizes) free radicals in the skin. Free radicals, which are formed from things like the sun, pollution, stress and smoking, damage the DNA of the cell, which can lead to premature aging and skin cancer. Vitamin C also boosts collagen production and reverses cell damage, which helps keep the skin firmer and younger, and even helps fade and prevent brown spots and pigmentation.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Form of Vitamin C.</strong>\u00a0Vitamin C comes in different forms\u2014<span class=\"s1\">L-ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ascorbyl palmitate and sodium ascorbyl phosphate, among others\u2014but not all of them are equal in terms of stability and absorption rate.\u00a0</span>\u201cAs with all active ingredients in skin care and critical with vitamin C, it is essential that it is well formulated and has good bioavailability and penetration,\u201d explains Dr. Magovern. \u201cIn other words, it is able to get to where it needs to go and do what it\u2019s supposed to do. Most serums on the market contain vitamin C in the form of L-ascorbic acid, but some experts prefer the ester form, called tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, which they believe can be more effective.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Concentration.</strong> Concentration is basically the strength of the acid, explains Dr. Magovern. \u201cA concentration of at least 10% L-ascorbic acid is recommended; however, you will find some products on the market that offer 15 or 20%. The concentration is important, but the best vitamin C serums combine other antioxidants and boosters like vitamin E and ferulic acid, which probably adds more value than just increasing the concentration alone.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Formulation.</strong>\u00a0While vitamin C alone has proven benefits, studies show that combining it with equally potent ingredients can heighten its efficacy. Dr. Magovern explains: \u201cThere is a great deal of evidence showing that combining vitamin C with vitamin E and ferulic acid makes for a much more potent antioxidant with added benefits. Vitamin E itself acts as an antioxidant and also enhances the function of vitamin C. It also helps to maintain the skin barrier. Ferulic acid enhances both vitamin C and vitamin E. Glutathione is another antioxidant that works synergistically with vitamin C and is one to keep your eye on. I think we will be hearing more and more about this one.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are different theories and ideas out there about how and when to use a vitamin C serum. Some experts believe that vitamin C should be applied at night in order to help skin repair itself while other sleep-restorative functions are taking place. Some believe that it should be applied during the day in order to help fight off free-radical damage as it accumulates through the day. For Dr. Magovern, it doesn\u2019t matter much which time of day you apply it; what matters more is that you remember to use it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for how often? Dr. Magovern mentions that you may not need to use it every day. \u201cThe receptors for vitamin C get saturated and it may not need to be applied every day,\u201d she says. \u201cYou may not get added benefit from daily application. I would recommend application at least every 48 to 72 hours.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Something else of importance to note is how you store your bottles to ensure potency. \u201cKeeping vitamin C bottles in a cool, dark place is best. You\u2019ll notice that formulas containing L-ascorbic acid will (and should) come in a brown or amber bottle, which is important to maintain stability,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf your serum starts to turn brown, it\u2019s probably time to get a new one, and it should probably be replaced at least every six months. However, if you are using it properly and being compliant with your skin care regimen, your bottle shouldn\u2019t last long.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin and typically break out when trying a new product, you\u2019d be happy to know that vitamin C is relatively safe for even the most sensitive skin, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t patch test your vitamin C just as you would any new product. \u201cI am not aware of any harmful side effects to topical vitamin C, other than the occasional acne breakout or irritation that may come from a formulation that may not agree with your skin,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cIf this happens, you could try another brand or formulation.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to boost your antioxidant intake? Here are 10 vitamin C serums that are actually worth every penny:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from 15 percent pure L-ascorbic acid, this Dermstore bestseller also features vitamin E and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-ferulic-acid/\">ferulic acid</a>, which makes this serum an antioxidant powerhouse, providing as much as 8x the skin\u2019s natural protection!

These skin care MVPs can effectively enhance your skin care regimen with their versatility and variety: They can be added to moisturizers, night creams and masks to enhance potency, be used as a spot treatment or as standalone actives that target just about every skin concern.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But with all the different types and ingredients available\u2014and all the hype that comes with new releases and cult products\u2014it can be difficult to figure out which bottle can give your skin that much-needed rejuvenation. Hence, it\u2019s important to understand the specific needs of your skin and how time, the environment and your lifestyle affects it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Fine lines and wrinkles are all part of the natural aging process as skin gets thinner, drier and less elastic with age, says board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.moderndermct.com/\">Rhonda Klein</a>. As early as your mid- to late-twenties, the production of the proteins collagen and elastin\u2014the building blocks of healthy skin\u2014slows down. Because they are being broken down faster than new ones are produced, it triggers the aging process that results in a dull complexion, sagging skin and folds and creases.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">External or environmental factors also play a role. Pollution, UV radiation and certain lifestyle habits like smoking all accelerate and contribute to the degradation of your skin\u2019s healthy cells and connective tissues, with some parts getting thicker and other thinner, adds scientist, author and skin care expert <a href=\"https://hannahsivak.com\">Dr. Hannah Sivak</a>. \u201cAt the molecular level, there are many changes in protein structures. Some proteins are being broken down and replaced with others that are different in amino acid sequence and physical behavior,\u201d explains Sivak.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike creams and lotions, serums are also able to go deeper into the skin\u2019s layers, says Heather Bennett, esthetician at <a href=\"https://bhrcenter.com/\">Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center</a>. \u201cAnti-wrinkle serums are more liquid than solid and therefore are able to penetrate multiple layers of skin more quickly and easily. The major benefits of serums are that they offer the most lightweight formula and give the most intensive results,\u201d adds Bennett.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAnti-aging serums and creams can help reduce environmental toxins, build collagen and elastin and smooth fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d adds Dr. Klein. But aside from reversing the changes caused by aging, serums can also help prevent premature wrinkles and fine lines from developing, says Dr. Sivak. \u201cThere are many ingredients that can prevent oxidation and modification of cellular components, including the very important DNA mutations caused by UV radiation,\u201d Dr. Sivak explains. \u201cOther ingredients can prevent lipid oxidation, preserving cellular integrity.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Identifying your skin\u2019s specific needs is the best way to choose an anti-aging serum. Below is a rundown of the best anti-aging serum ingredients that will plump up your skin, boost its defenses against environmental aggressors and keep those dreaded signs of aging at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Say goodbye to fine lines and wrinkles and give your daily skin care regimen a boost with our top recommended anti-aging serums, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There\u2019s a reason this serum has been getting hundreds of five-star reviews on Dermstore!

Using moisturizers regularly!\u00a0\u201cMoisturizers add a layer of protection to your skin,\u201d explains\u00a0<a href=\"https://johnsondermatology.com/\">board-certified dermatologist Sandra Johnson, M.D</a>. \u201cSkipping out on regular moisturizing could lead to skin irritation, rash or infections.\u201d If you\u2019re new to using moisturizer, or would like to make improvements, here are a few helpful tips and tricks to consider:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to <a href=\"https://www.wilmingtondermatologycenter.com/\">board-certified dermatologist Rosalyn George, M.D.,</a> most moisturizers contain a mixture of the three categories: occlusive, emollients and humectants. Here\u2019s how they differ:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/your-burning-questions-about-moisturizers-answered-by-a-dermatologist/\">When choosing a moisturizer</a>, consider your skin type and concern. Is your skin oily and breaks out easily, or\u00a0is it too dry that nothing you apply seems to keep the flakes away? Is sensitivity or wrinkles a concern? If you\u2019re in the market for a good moisturizer, we\u2019re here to help! Scroll down to see our top picks based on your skin type or concern, as well as budget.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because your skin is on the normal side doesn\u2019t mean you can skip using a moisturizer. However, because your skin doesn\u2019t need to address any specific concern, maintaining a healthy skin barrier and protecting it against damaging pollutants and UV rays should be your primary focus. Dr. Johnson recommends choosing a simple moisturizer with as few ingredients as possible, naming\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_SkinMedica_100155.htm\"><u>SkinMedica</u></a> as one of her top choices.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you read the 75+ 5-star reviews for this everyday moisturizer, one word will stick out: \u201clight.\u201d When applied to the face and neck, many users remark on the lightweight yet thoroughly hydrating results, thanks to sodium hyaluronate (hyaluronic acid) which retains <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-hyaluronic-acid-serums/\">up to 1,000 its weight in water</a>. Vitamins C and E help give the skin a brightening and antioxidant boost.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This soothing cream is a great all-around moisturizer.\u00a0Not only does it\u00a0deliver long-lasting moisture, it also helps promote skin healing after chemical peels, laser treatments and sunburn. For an extra dose of moisture, use day and night. One Dermstore shopper advises to go easy on this moisturizer if you don\u2019t have dry skin: \u201cI first found out this cream when I got a facial. It is a great moisturizer and a little goes a long way!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dry skin is often lacking natural oils and lubricants, thus resulting in an itchy or tight feeling. Dr. Johnson explains that thicker cream moisturizers are often oil-based, making them a better option for dry skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have dry skin, you understand the need for something that truly quenches your skin\u2019s thirst and keeps flakes at bay. Enter Epoince Intensive Nourishing Cream. Highly emollient and rich, it works to nourish skin from within and improves its barrier with shea butter, peptides and natural oils. An optimal choice for dry skin, dry climates, cold weather or any other situation when your skin might need extra moisture.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Flaky skin, cracks and tightness are all woes related to dry skin\u2014and not very fun to deal with! Luckily, First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream utilizes oatmeal extract and allantoin to alleviate irritation while leaving a protective film on skin to add nourishment and comfort. This rich formula is also ideal for those suffering with eczema and can be dabbed on parched patches of the body like the elbow, heels and hands.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from lightweight hydration, this moisturizer offers exfoliating benefits. Papain derived from papaya enzymes works to smooth and exfoliate skin while hyaluronic acid and tamarind extract plump and moisturize. \u201cAnother great product that moisturizes even oily skin with quick absorption for a radiant glow. Even beneficial in my high-humidity climate without resulting in breakouts,\u201d explains one Dermstore review.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shine can be a major obstacle to face when dealing with oily skin. Thankfully, this lightweight formula from La Roche-Posay offers a mattifying formula that also helps tighten pores, balance oil production and protect against free-radical damage. Apply to the face and neck and take advantage of the vitamins, antioxidants and salicylic acid packed within the moisturizer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you suffer from red, itchy skin due to rosacea, eczema or other factors, Eminence Organic Skin Care offers an entire line made specifically for this skin type. Formulated with pure, natural ingredients, this moisturizer features antioxidant-rich rosehip extract, which hydrates and helps balance out your skin, while pectin helps strengthen it. One Dermstore shopper describes the texture as \u201ccreamy and light at the same time.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This moisturizer is formulated with a minimal number of ingredients, including healing and nutrient-rich thermal spring water, to calm irritation and nourish and protect. It can also be used after chemical peels or laser procedures as a recovery treatment, hence the name. One Dermstore shopper had this to say: \u201cSince my last breakout, I\u2019ve been using Recovery Cream and have had no eczema at all, which is unheard of for me in the winter.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Balance is key when dealing with combination skin\u2014and this product, which thoroughly hydrates without leaving a greasy residue, delivers exactly that. Vitamin E works as an antioxidant while a blend of natural purifying extracts including licorice and ginger restores skin\u2019s moisture and minimizes the appearance of pores. One Dermstore shopper describes it as her \u201choly grail product,\u201d saying that \u201cDaily moisture is perfect for my combination 40s skin. My face stays hydrated all day with neither dry nor oily spots.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Free of fragrance and oil, this moisturizer contains only 11 ingredients, one of those being mineralizing thermal water, which makes up 89% of the formula in addition to hyaluronic acid. It has a non-sticky, gel texture, two drops of which can be used alone as a moisturizer or layered underneath a cream.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Daily upkeep is essential for mature skin, which includes limiting collagen breakdown and protecting skin from further damage, according to Dr. Johnston. The skin barrier diminishes as we age and skin becomes more sensitive, adding to the long list of reasons to use sun protection daily.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Described as \u201cthick without being heavy,\u201d this cream can be used day and night to calm irritation, fight free radicals and encourage hyaluronic acid production within the skin. It\u2019s composed of an advanced complex that discourages collagen degradation and promotes firmness and elasticity. One reviewer had this to say: \u201cThis cream is a dream. After using this, I received several comments on my skin\u2026a little goes a long way and the bottle will last a long time.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve been wary about introducing a retinol cream into your skin regimen, Paula\u2019s Choice offers an affordable, gentle option to meet your anti-aging needs. Retinol, a form of vitamin A, is infused into this silky moisturizer to target existing fine lines and wrinkles and protect against free-radical damage. Green tea, ceramides and shea butter also work to trap moisture in the skin.</p>"},

As the thinnest and most sensitive skin on your body, the area around your eyes is the first to show signs of aging and the consequences of inadequate sleep, squinting and sun damage. Needless to say, whether you\u2019re in your 20s or 50s, the skin surrounding your peepers needs an extra dose of TLC. And that\u2019s where eye creams come in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While your serums and moisturizers may do a good job preserving and maintaining the overall health of your skin, they may not be enough to provide that extra nourishment needed by your under-eye area. \u201cThe skin under and around the eyes is thin and can dry out easily. While there are oil glands on the eyelids, the skin can get dry, flaky and irritated, especially when exacerbated by cold, dry winter air or by windy, summer environments,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/stayskinsafe\">Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, FAAD</a>. \u201cEye creams can be used for various reasons, including moisturizing, reducing inflammation, anti-aging, improving skin texture and reducing the appearance of dark circles.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">That said, deciding on which product can help your eyes look refreshed and rested can be a tad overwhelming, especially when you consider the wide variety of formulas available. Fortunately, narrowing down your options is not as hard as you may think once you\u2019ve taken stock of your eye area\u2019s most pressing needs and the best ingredients that will help address your concerns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>\u00a0</strong>Whether it\u2019s eye wrinkles or morning puffiness giving you grief, there\u2019s an eye cream that\u2019s right for you. Below, we\u2019ve listed down our top eye cream picks for every under-eye concern and budget.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the gloom under your eyes can often be blamed on lack of sleep, Dr. Shainhouse says dark circles can also be caused by several factors, including genetics, swelling, engorged blood vessels and even shadows cast by raised facial features. \u201cLook for ingredients like arnica, vitamin K and caffeine to help temporarily shrink blood vessels,\u201d says Dr. Shainhouse. These antioxidant ingredients are known to improve circulation and calm swelling, helping to minimize puffiness and preventing blood from pooling beneath your eyes and causing it to appear darker.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for an eye cream that will banish those shadows under your eyes, look no further than this antioxidant powerhouse. Its powerful formula blends three percent vitamin E, two percent ferulic acid and 10 percent THD ascorbate\u2013a type of vitamin C that is 50 times more potent than traditional forms\u2013with olive oil, caffeine, jojoba and hyaluronic acid, delivering the ultimate pampering for your peepers. It relieves swelling and lightens dark circles while plumping up the skin and diminishing fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: $65</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">True to its name, this multitasking eye cream works hard at reducing the appearance of dark circles and puffiness, refining wrinkles and fine lines, improving elasticity and protecting your delicate eyes from environmental damage. Thanks to its eye-opening formula that includes vitamin A, niacinamide, alpha arbutin, glycerin and FAB Antioxidant Booster</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your under-eye skin tends to be drier and thinner, so it\u2019s no surprise that the first signs of aging most people notice are eye wrinkles and crow\u2019s feet. Moisture is key if you want to keep fine lines under control, so Dr. Shainhouse suggests looking for eye products with hydrating and moisturizing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, AHAs, ceramides, essential oils (like argan, coconut and avocado oils) and botanical extracts. \u201cMoisturizing the skin makes the skin plumper, so lines appear less deep,\u201d adds Dr. Shainhouse. Additionally, retinoids and peptides can help rebuild and encourage elastin and collagen production, slowing down the formation of new wrinkles and refining the appearance of existing ones.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This dermatologist-approved eye cream is formulated for all skin types, especially for those with mature and sensitive skin. Its firming formula features an advanced blend of ingredients\u2014antioxidants, vitamin E, titanium dioxide and dimethicone\u2014that strengthens the body\u2019s natural skin renewal process and boosts collagen and elastin production. The result? Noticeably brighter and more youthful-looking eye area in less time than traditional eye creams.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may be lighter on your wallet, but this rejuvenating eye treatment is a complete heavyweight when it comes to targeting crow\u2019s feet, sagging skin and other signs of aging. Its anti-aging formula blends tried-and-tested wrinkle-fighting ingredients such as hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, green tea, algae extracts and a non-irritating retinol. Best for mature skin, it blurs fine lines and creases, protects against free radicals and hydrates and plumps skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eye bags and puffiness can be particularly daunting to deal with, especially when they\u2019re caused by factors beyond your control\u2013genes and the natural aging process. Most of the time, however, those puffy eyes are simply the results of poor circulation and fluid retention due to late-night junk food cravings, extended happy hours, allergies and lack of sleep. And while your body will naturally get rid of the excess water on its own, you can help the de-puffing and shrinking process along with an eye cream that contains caffeine, cucumber and antioxidants like green tea and vitamin C, which all work to reduce swelling by improving blood flow and tightening skin and blood vessels.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to rejuvenating and restoring vitality to tired and puffy eyes, this eye cream definitely doesn\u2019t hold back. Best for all skin types, this gentle yet potent eye cream features an advanced complex of PSP growth factors to stimulate cell regeneration. Hyaluronic acid and matrix proteins plump and repair sagging skin while antioxidants protect from environmental damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Featuring an advanced complex of three peptides, botanical oils and vitamins, this triple-action treatment increases collagen production, circulation and capillary function to restore tone and texture and reduce swelling and puffiness. It also aids in brightening dark circles and refining wrinkles while helping to moisturize and firm the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Collagen and elastin production start to slow down in your mid- to late 20s and can be further accelerated by sun exposure and certain lifestyle factors like smoking, unhealthy diet, alcohol and poor sleeping habits. So when it comes to keeping wrinkles and crow\u2019s feet at bay, it\u2019s important to stay one step ahead. \u201cWhile we can\u2019t avoid getting older, we can try to slow it down by feeding our skin with the molecules and protein precursors it needs to protect and rebuild its collagen structure,\u201d says Dr. Shainhouse. These include peptides and growth factors that can penetrate the surface layers of the skin and provide the necessary building blocks in creating new collagen and antioxidants (like vitamin C, green tea and acai and coffee berries) that help prevent UV-induced oxidation and collagen degradation, adds Dr. Shainhouse.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This nourishing eye treatment provides immediate and lasting anti-aging results to the eye area, thanks to its optical diffusers that instantly brighten the eyes and flavonoids and peptides that improve dark circles and puffiness. It also features blueberry extract and proxylane that nourish and boost elasticity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With a retexturizing and moisturizing formula that also features a chemical-free sunscreen, this eye cream lives up to its promise of total eye care. Alpha hydroxyl acids rejuvenate the eye area, botanical extracts reduce puffiness and optical light diffusers improve the appearance of dark circles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: $53</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Not all eye creams are created equal, but this nourishing eye treatment hits all the marks if you\u2019re looking for a way to banish puffiness and dark circles without the risk of irritating your delicate eye area. Thanks to its gentle, powered-by-nature formula that features superfood ingredients like wild plum juice, green tea extracts, wheat protein and grape oil. It brightens the eyes, protects from free radical damage and keeps skin hydrated while maintaining moisture and refining signs of aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Formulated for sensitive skin types, this gentle eye cream soothes and protects the eye area with nourishing and soothing ingredients that include thermal spring water to calm irritation and tightness, dextran sulfate to diminish puffiness and antioxidants, hyaluronic acid and vitamin E to protect and maintain moisture. This dermatologist-approved formula is paraben- and fragrance-free.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Price: $27</strong></p>"},

Formulated with 5% purified-grade lactic acid, this serum buffs away dull layers of skin and other pore-clogging impurities, instantly transforming your complexion while continuously stimulating new collagen production.

This action enhances the body\u2019s ability to make collagen and elastin, repair cells and stimulate\u00a0blood circulation. The best part?

Your veggies and spices start to wilt and dry up, while prepared meals start to form oil at the top of the plastic containers. And that milk? One whiff and you know it\u2019s not okay to drink. But what about when you look in your makeup bag, your shower or medicine cabinet? It\u2019s not always clear if your foundation or shampoo is okay to use, or if it\u2019s time to toss it out and replace the goods. Using expired products is not only a little gross, but it can also be troublesome for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe main problem with old products is that they can decompose. The chemicals can separate and cause problems with the skin. I have seen burns and irritation from old products. They can also harbor bacteria and cause a skin infection or even worse: they can have viruses and cause a herpes outbreak,\u201d explains <a href=\"http://drjaliman.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Debra Jailman</a>, dermatologist and assistant professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Yikes, right? As dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/stayskinsafe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Tsippora Shainhouse, MD, FAAD</a> explains, generally speaking, you should look for three things when considering how healthy your product is: \u201cIf the product looks different than when you first opened it, throw it out. Or if there is any change in texture, color, smell or if the product begins to separate, throw it out. Or if you used the tool or product over an infected area and can\u2019t sanitize it, probably throw it out, too.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Want to know specifically how long your coveted items last? Here, dermatologists tell all.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though you don\u2019t need us to remind you that <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/sunscreen-myths-debunked/\">wearing sunscreen is important</a> every single day (and not only in the hottest heat wave of summertime), most people won\u2019t go through a big bottle of sunscreen quickly. Especially if you\u2019re only wearing a thin layer each time you apply, you might hold onto your SPF for many seasons. Dr. Shainhouse advises that if you open a bottle, be careful and pay attention.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life:</strong> Around two years, depending on the quality of care. \u201cSunscreens tend to have a long shelf life, and should be effective for about two years after opening,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says. \u201cHowever, exposure to heat, when bottles are left in the sun, can cause the active sunscreen agent and vehicle ingredients to break down faster, and can also change the consistency of the lotion.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to tell if it\u2019s bad</strong>: Try to think of your bottle of sunscreen in the same context you might consider that carton of milk in the fridge. When it starts to change shade or smell funky\u2014step away. \u201cIf you notice that it has changed from white to yellow, smells off or that the cream is separating, toss it out,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse advises.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if you opt for a more luxe brand of shampoo, most companies offer oversized bottles that over time are more cost-effective than spending money on a new bottle of hair wash every month. (And if you have longer hair, maybe even sooner than that.) But if you\u2019re worried about its performance weakening over time, rest easy. Unlike most beauty products, shampoo lasts a long time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: You can keep these for a while; just make sure they\u2019re tightly sealed and kept in a clean shower. \u201cClosed shampoo bottles will last for many years on the shelf. Open ones can last for a couple of years, too, so long as they are closed tightly and don\u2019t get diluted down with shower water, or contaminated with mildew,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse notes. She also adds that a gel shampoo will last much longer than a creamy one.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to tell if it\u2019s bad</strong>: Since you wash your hair each day (or every other day), you\u2019re going to be used to the scent and texture. If you notice that either of those is off, Dr. Shainhouse says to throw it out and buy a new one.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve made the swap to bar soap from your shower gel, you\u2019ll know that a bar of soap will last for quite a long time. But is it okay to use for months upon months? Whichever way you choose to cleanse your body, you have full permission to take your time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: If you\u2019re given a set of five soaps or body gels for your birthday, it\u2019s very likely that it will take you a while to get through them. \u201cDon\u2019t open them,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says, because they can last for years if they\u2019re still in their packaging. Once you\u2019ve broken the seal, you still have a year or so, she says. The only exception is creamy washes, as Dr. Shainhouse notes, they \u201cbegin to turn off-color or smell rancid more quickly, due to the oils in them.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to tell if it\u2019s bad</strong>: Again, utilize your five senses to make a judgment call. \u201cIf the color, smell or texture changes or looks wrong, or if the product separates, splurge for a new bottle,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By now, it\u2019s part of your daily routine to wake up, wash\u00a0your face, turn on the coffee pot and apply your moisturizer. Most people become pretty loyal to their trusted moisturizer and you should be equally as dedicated to making sure your old faithful is still going strong.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: Dr. Shainhouse says that a good moisturizer will last up to a year\u00a0and that as long as it looks and feels as it did when you first popped open the bottle, you\u2019re good to go.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to tell if it\u2019s bad</strong>: Over time and depending on the conditions in which you keep your moisturizer, you\u2019ll start to notice a difference in color and even smell. If this happens, say goodbye to that bottle.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s as if makeup companies are in cahoots with one another, getting you completely dependent on one shade of foundation and then discontinuing it, right when you need a refill. \u201cDon\u2019t save the end of the bottle of the \u2018best color\u2019 for years, because the product will most definitely begin to break down and clump or separate over time,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says. So how long can you keep it?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: Dr. Shainhouse says you have about a year to hold onto your prized liquid foundation before it\u2019s time to break up with it. However, if you have a sponge-style foundation or a cream-based one that requires you to re-dip your fingers or sponge blenders into it, cut yourself off at six months. Why? \u201cBecause they are more easily contaminated with acne, causing bacteria or yeast,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to tell if it\u2019s bad</strong>: \u201cIf you notice a change in smell, color or consistency, throw it out,\u201d she says. You might also notice oil beginning to form and it not mixing or absorbing into your skin, which is an indicator that it\u2019s no longer good to use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though not everyone is pro-blush (you might be more in the bronze or highlighter camp), this beauty product tends to last a while, making you look brighter and sometimes, even younger.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: Dr. Shainhouse says that powder blushes will last a few years if they aren\u2019t broken, while a gel-stick or a cream blush might dry out faster with consistent use. No matter what type you use, make sure you clean your brushes frequently to prevent breakouts.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to know if it\u2019s bad</strong>: If your gel or cream blush gets super sticky, completely dry or if it changes its texture, starts to smell or all of the above, Dr. Shainhouse says to get rid of it ASAP.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most women have various eyeshadow palettes for different occasions: date night, work, brunch with the gals, etc. Luckily, most shadows will stand by your side loyally through all of your adventures.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: Here, Dr. Shainhouse says it\u2019s important to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/how-to-clean-makeup-brushes/\">keep your eye brushes clean</a> so your favorite shades can last for years.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to know if it\u2019s bad</strong>: Apart from general aging over time, like with any product, Dr. Shainhouse explains that the way you use your products can determine its lifetime value. \u201cOils on the eyelids can transfer to the powder palette if you \u2018double dip,\u2019 which can potentially affect the color of the product,\u201d she says. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll want to toss it out.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if you don\u2019t wear any other makeup, you probably still rely on mascara to make your eyes look brighter. However, this popular product doesn\u2019t last as long as many of its cosmetic friends.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: If you use it every single day (or most days), your mascara should only last three to six months, Dr. Shainhouse says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to know when it\u2019s bad</strong>: There are some dangers with mascara, simply because of how it\u2019s applied. \u201cThis is a product that screams \u2018double dipping\u2019 and it is applied to an \u2018open area\u2019 that comes in contact with body fluids, so it is prone to breeding bacteria and yeast in the tube,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse explains. \u201cIf the product starts to smell off, becomes thick and clumpy or changes color, throw it out. If you used it while you had a cold or pink eye, throw it out,\u201d she concludes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some ladies don\u2019t feel like their best self until they have some color on their pucker, and if that\u2019s you, you probably have a signature shade. While it probably won\u2019t last you a full year, lipstick can make it up to 365 days, if kept properly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: \u201cIf you use the same stick daily, get a new one every six to 12 months,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to know if it\u2019s bad</strong>: When you can\u2019t apply it anymore because it\u2019s dried out, looks cracked or the color\u00a0has changed, it\u2019s time to toss it out. Dr. Shainhouse says this happens with exposure to skin oils, bacteria and oxygen.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Raise your hand if you still have a nail polish you bought when you were in high school that you just can\u2019t get rid of. (Guilty.) Though you might have sentimental attachment to one of your first beauty products, Dr. Shainhouse says it\u2019s time to let it go.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Shelf life</strong>: \u201cNail polishes tend to get thick, dry and sticky after a year or so,\u201d she says. Though she adds that you can try to thin them out by adding acetone. But if they start going bitter, let them go.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>How to know if it\u2019s bad</strong>: In addition to seeing the color separate from the ingredients or change completely, it\u2019s not a bad idea to get rid of nail polish if for no other reason than sanitary concerns. \u201cThe alcohol and chemicals in nail polish do not make it a great breeding ground for bacteria and fungus, so even if they are safe to use, if they get thick, they just look messy. However, don\u2019t share polish with someone who has toenail fungus, because it is very difficult to treat, if you do contract it,\u201d Dr. Shainhouse says.</p>"},

It also means you need to pay special care and attention when using an eye cream. Here we\u2019ll discuss what to look for in an eye cream formula to target your specific under-eye concerns, and how to apply it for best results.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eye creams can help reduce puffiness and crow\u2019s feet, brighten up dark circles and make your face look younger and more awake. Some formulas are designed to address one of these concerns, while others are do-it-all products. Here are some ingredients to look for when seeking out an eye cream:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eye creams are super concentrated, so a pea-size amount is all you need for both eyes. For that delicate area, use your ring finger since it naturally has the lightest touch. You don\u2019t want to put too much pressure on the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To apply, start at the inner corner underneath your eye, applying small dots in a semi-circle up to your brow bone.\u00a0Gently tap in that semi-circle pattern to stimulate circulation until the product is fully absorbed.\u00a0Be sure not to pull or stretch the skin while you\u2019re doing this.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember: Don\u2019t get too close to your eye to avoid irritation. Also, unless the product label directs you to, avoid applying on or near your eyelids.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After applying your eye cream, wait about 90 seconds before applying concealer or other skin care products to give it time to fully absorb.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Still unsure?

Some people prefer to use it during the day to make their concealer look better; others prefer using it at night.\u00a0As for how this step fits within your routine, you\u2019ll want to apply your eye cream after cleansing and toning and before your moisturizer or night cream.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Kaitlin Willow wears many hats at Dermstore: copywriter, marketing/SEO strategist and community manager.

Just like skin types, serums come in a few variations that deliver specific results such as hydration, brightening and anti-aging. One formula we\u2019re turning our attention to that\u2019s gaining a lot of popularity lately is the exfoliating serum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019ve ever looked at your complexion in the mirror and noticed a dull tinge, exfoliation can help lift the veil and reveal brighter, more glowy skin. But before you reach for a physical exfoliant such as sugar scrub, consider this: You can add a serum to your regimen with similar benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cExfoliating serums have blends of acids that work together to remove dead skin cells,\u201d explains Jaliman. These serums work best on skin experiencing \u201cdryness, hyperpigmentation, fine lines and wrinkles,\u201d as the acids help slough off dead skin and tackle concerns having to do with discoloration\u2014hello, sunspots!\u2014and premature signs of aging. That said, some acids can also help banish acne, as they work to target impurities and debris that often clogs pores.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to exfoliating serums, it\u2019s all about the ingredients\u2014specifically the acids, which are responsible for lifting away dead skin cells. Here are the ingredients you should consider when shopping for an exfoliating serum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s what you need to know when choosing the right exfoliating serums for normal, dry, oily, mature and sensitive skin types.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind that exfoliating products aren\u2019t meant to be used every day. \u201cIf we use exfoliating products too often, [it] can cause skin irritations,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. \u201cI would recommend using two to three times a week, depending on the type of acid. Some [acids] are much gentler and may be used more often,\u201d she adds. Always check your product label first or consult your dermatologist.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to reap the rewards of exfoliating serums? Our top picks, below.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Per Dr. Jaliman\u2019s suggestion, this oil-free serum from SkinCeuticals is an ideal formula for dry skin.

More important, is having it as one of the key ingredients in your skin care products worth the hefty price tag? The short answer, according to\u00a0two prominent dermatologists, is yes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here, they break down the science behind how peptides work, what they actually do for our skin and body, how we can get more of them, and the best peptide-infused skin care formulas to look out for.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before we talk about peptides, it\u2019s important to understand what amino acids are. \u201cPeptides are strings of amino acids, which are the building blocks that make up proteins in our body, including <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-does-collagen-do/\">collagen in the skin</a>,\u201d explains Dr. Whitney Bowe, renowned New York City\u2013based dermatologist and author.\u00a0\u201cWithout these proteins, we will see wrinkles, brittle nails and dry hair that\u2019s prone to breakage.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cPeptides serve as the building blocks for not only new collagen, but also elastin fibers,\u201d adds Dr. Deanne Mraz Robinson, partner at Modern Dermatology in Westport, CT. \u201cThese fibers are the building blocks of our skin and add to tissue firmness and elasticity.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from being essential to the skin\u2019s\u00a0structure and function (important factors in firmness, texture and overall appearance), peptides are found in every human cell and play an important role in how the body functions, often acting as a biologic messenger. \u201cWe need peptides at all times. If we are deficient in them, our body cannot function,\u201d says Dr. Robinson. \u201cPeptides have a myriad of uses in the body, from being the building blocks for enzymes, hormones and an energy source.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">So if peptides are already present within the body, why do we need more of them? The answer, according to experts, is aging.\u00a0\u201cWe lose 1% of our remaining collagen per year after\u00a0age\u00a030,\u201d says Dr. Robinson.\u00a0\u201cOur skin\u2019s natural communication channels also slow down over time.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">But simply slathering peptides onto your skin doesn\u2019t necessarily give you more of them. According to Dr. Bowe, how they work is a little more complex:\u00a0\u201cYour body sees these peptides as \u2018signals\u2019 that you need to heal, which tells your body to produce more collagen where you need it most,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf you are healing from an injury in your ankle, those peptides will signal your body to focus its repair efforts in that joint. If your skin is aging prematurely, those peptides might signal your skin to boost its production of collagen and even hyaluronic acid, plumping up your skin and restoring a healthy skin barrier.\u00a0When you introduce exogenous peptides onto the skin in the form of a moisturizer or serum, it tricks the skin into thinking there\u2019s been an injury or wound, and it stimulates our collagen-boosting processes.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to skin care, not all peptides are created equal.\u00a0\u201cWhile there are hundreds of peptides,\u00a0there are specific peptides that are more\u00a0efficacious\u00a0for the skin than others,\u201d explains Dr. Robinson. For example, <strong>carrier peptides</strong> deliver trace minerals to the skin to boost collagen, while <strong>enzyme inhibitor peptides</strong> work to slow down the skin\u2019s natural breakdown of collagen. <strong>Signal peptides</strong> send messages to different parts of the skin to promote collagen, elastin and other proteins; and <strong>neurotransmitter peptides</strong>, touted as \u201cBotox-like,\u201d block the release of chemicals that cause the muscle contraction of expression lines, thus smoothing wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to enhancing the skin, Dr. Bowe recommends getting peptides from topical skin care products. However, she\u00a0stresses the importance of looking at the product\u2019s formulation: the stability of its ingredients and its ability to penetrate the skin barrier. This is where a consultation with your dermatologist may be helpful.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Finding the right product type can go a long way too. For example, instead of choosing a peptide-enriched cleanser, Dr. Robinson recommends opting for products that are not easily washed off the skin, like a moisturizer, eye cream or serum. She also suggests opting for products with copper peptides, which \u201chelp not only generate collagen but also maintain the collagen you generate.\u201d\u00a0She also suggests looking for products that also introduce niacinamide, vitamin C and antioxidants into the mix, in addition to peptides. One of her product recommendations is\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_BIOcenterdotCREAM+BioRestorative+Skin+Cream_11059.htm#headingDetails\">NeoCutis Bio Cream Bio-Restorative Skin Cream.</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once you find the right cream or serum for you, Dr. Robinson recommends applying it to clean skin twice daily, under makeup and SPF.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from topical products, incorporating collagen-rich foods like bone broth, and adding a reputable collagen supplement to your diet, can also work wonders for your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Are you ready to pack a punch with peptides? Here are Dermstore\u2019s top tried-and-true products to boost collagen and kick up your skin care game:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This product features a 73% complex of 21 peptides and neuropeptides, plus two gamma proteins derived from Asian natto gum, to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, improve skin elasticity and even skin tone and texture. As if that\u2019s not enough, this power-packed serum is also infused with squalane, a hyaluronic acid complex and vitamins A, C and E to nourish and hydrate your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Dermstore bestseller, this serum is housed in a dual chamber airless pump to combine two active formulas that smooth skin and improve tone and texture by regenerating skin cells. The first chamber dispenses TNS complex, rich in growth factors, while the second chamber includes the brand\u2019s APS Corrective Complex, a combination of antioxidants, arbutin, hyaluronic filling spheres and three different peptides. The dual formulas work in synergy to strengthen sagging skin and reduce inflammation and wrinkles.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Known in skin care circles as the \u201cCadillac of peptides,\u201d PSP<sup>\u00ae</sup>, which stands for \u201cprocessed skin cell proteins,\u201d is a blend of proteins and polypeptides, formulated to revive skin and increase firmness, brightness and elasticity. It\u2019s a dermatologist favorite for sensitive skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A.G.E., or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/is-sugar-bad-for-skin/\">advanced glycation end-products</a> is a major factor of the natural aging process and can lead to under-eye creepiness. Fortunately, peptides in this cream work with antioxidant flavonoids and blueberry extract to combat dark circles, puffiness and crow\u2019s feet over time while optical diffusers give the eye contour instant radiance.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This nighttime moisturizer is oil-free and enriched with ceramides and rice protein peptides to moisturize and repair skin while at rest. Cell growth and collagen formation within the skin is credited to peptides, resulting in a boost in elasticity. An affordable pick for peptide technology!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A gentler form of vitamin A, retinaldehyde combines with a patented pro-elastin peptide to fill lines and wrinkles and help strengthen and firm skin. Bottled in an airless pump, it also contains vitamin E and thermal spring water to add extra anti-inflammatory and soothing properties.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Copper tripeptide growth factor plus a 15% concentration of L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) smooth skin and improve scar tissue, stretch marks and uneven skin. Known for its wound-healing powers, copper tripeptide is released naturally in the body during an injury, making it a perfect regenerating compound to be utilized in the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A spot treatment serum featuring the neurotransmitter peptide, argireline\u00a0actively works for 12 hours to visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles caused by repeated facial movements. It\u2019s recommended to be patted onto the forehead, crow\u2019s feet, and lines around the mouth. In addition to argireline, the serum features ultra-moisturizing sodium hyaluronate, able to hold 1000 times its weight in water, along with other nourishing ingredients from olives and rice bran wax.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Peptides work to rebuild and repair damaged cells and signal skin to produce collagen, slowing the aging process. It\u2019s a go-to moisturizer for a large range of women and men, including those with sensitive, dry and acne-prone skin. The \u201ctransformation\u201d comes from a patented balance of not only peptides but also alpha hydroxy acid, aloe vera, hyaluronic acid and antioxidants.</p>"},

Because of its anti-fungal, anti-microbial and antibacterial properties, sulfur is used in skin care to help ease the effects of acne, psoriasis, warts, dandruff, eczema and folliculitis. Creams, lotions and bar soaps containing sulfur are often used to unclog pores, absorb excess oil and relieve swelling and redness related to acne.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"#top\">Back to Top</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Short Definition:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An oil extracted from almonds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Long Definition:</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sweet almond oil is packed with antioxidants, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E, which help strengthen and maintain the skin\u2019s moisture barrier.

You can find antioxidants in popular fruits like strawberries and blueberries, but there\u2019s one less well-known fruit that also has major benefits. We\u2019re talking about lilikoi, which <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Eminence+Organic+Skin+Care_500221.htm\">Eminence Organic Skin Care</a> is utilizing in its new mineral sunscreen line.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to being tasty, lilikoi also has skin benefits: oil from the seeds (which Eminence Organics has used in its latest line of sun care) is a great source of <a href=\"https://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/fruits-and-fruit-juices/1987/2\">vitamin C</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/antioxidants-in-skin-care/\">antioxidants</a>. That means it helps improve visible signs of aging and damage caused by UV rays and pollutants. \u201cUVA rays are the number one cause of aging,\u201d Eminence Organics President Boldijarre Koronczay explains. \u201cThey destroy collagen, contribute to a lack of elasticity and tone and cause thicker looking skin\u2014what I call \u2018alligator skin.'\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to a study published in the <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29491276\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Journal of Nutritional Science and Vitaminology</a></em>, passion fruit seed extract also increases skin hydration.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond topical application, lilikoi has health benefits when taken orally.

A study published in <em><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27374527\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Food Chemistry</a></em> highlights passion fruit extract\u2019s ability to protect red blood cells against damaging free radical molecules, thanks to its high level of polyphenol, a type of antioxidant derived from plants.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Eminence Organics offers a couple of sunscreen choices to help people of all different skin types and concerns get the sun protection that is necessary to keep their skin healthy. Its new mineral SPF collection featuring lilikoi is for those concerned with environmental stressors beyond UV damage (think: pollution, smoking, etc.) The new collection contains three products with superb sun protection. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the two currently available at Dermstore:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it\u2019s great:</strong> This light cream is suitable for use by all skin types.

News</em>, <em>The Doctors</em>, <em>The Today Show</em>, <em>Pickler &amp; Ben</em>, <em>Good Day LA</em>, <em>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</em>, <em>Revenge Body</em> and <em>VH1\u2019s Hollywood Exes</em>. When she\u2019s not nurturing her patients at Beauty Park Medical Spa in Los Angeles or taking care of her beautiful family, Nurse Jamie is coming up with the latest medical devices and cutting-edge skin care products. Here, she talks to Dermstore about the latest advances in cosmetic surgery, the best way to maintain post-procedure skin and the worst beauty mistakes most women make.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Nurse Jamie:</strong> We are all little snowflakes so everyone is going to have a different treatment plan. This year, body sculpting is big\u2014from banning the bra strap fat to firming the tush\u2013these never go away. Laser hair removal, Botox, filler and glowing skin are always on trend.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">This year we\u2019ve also seen a lift in high-tech tools. Devices and home-based skin care are a big part of my regimen and I make everyone participate. I have a range of Hollywood patients who use my products daily and religiously, like our <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Beauty+Bear+Age+Delay+Pillow+-+Midnight+Gray_66244.htm\">Nurse Jamie Beauty Bear Pillow</a>, which has a huge following of leading ladies like Jessica Alba, Ruby Rose, Jenna Dewan, Olivia Culpo, Emily Ratajkowski and Shay Mitchell. This keeps the delicate skin around the eyes and neck line-free and helps to stop atrophy from being more evident on one side of the face.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I always say, \u201cIf Botox and filler were drowning, I would save filler first.\u201d But the trend now is combination therapy: doing less of both actually looks more natural.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is hard to give a one-protocol treatment program because we are all individuals and we pride ourselves at Nurse Jamie Beauty Park Spa in fully integrated programs customized for each person to meet their best skin results. Some are genetically blessed and don\u2019t really do more than an oxygen facial and our insta-famous beauty tool the Uplift roller to drain puffiness, help tone muscle and tighten skin combined with LED therapy and oxygen therapy. Another secret weapon I use is a treatment called the head-to-toe skin tightening without downtime to make any celebrity look like they have spent the last month in a health spa.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In general, since we all start to lose collagen production and skin elasticity starting age 25, we usually will use a range of laser procedures for skin texture and to boost complexion.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">One pre-party treatment we do is the Hydrating Uplift Facial. This helps transform the skin from the inside out using the power of platinum. We use a microcurrent technology for resurfacing, lifting and tightening, which smooths texture and fine lines and helps stimulate the muscles, blood flow and oxygenation.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to do something outside a doctor\u2019s office, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Instant+UpLift_66249.htm\">the Nurse Jamie UpLift</a> is ideal to help serums and products be absorbed. It also has a lifting and tightening effect and has a great anti-inflammatory property. You can use it every day but specifically just before an event for a more open-eyed look or more defined cheek. This works well for face and body so it helps with stretch marks and skin smoothing for waistline, hips and thighs too. Trust me, this is a celebrity secret. (Don\u2019t believe me? Do one side of your face for just one minute then look in the mirror.)</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">For day-of events, you need to focus on complexion and texture in a non-invasive way or only protocols with no downtime and no risk. Don\u2019t try something new on the day of an event. I also suggest a magical elixir, like our new <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Miracle+Base+Beauty+Oil+_78332.htm\">Miracle Base</a>. It is pure luxury in a bottle and will give your skin an amazing finish and a picture-perfect canvas for makeup.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">But don\u2019t forget red-carpet prep needs to happen every day too. Eat well, sleep well on the right pillow (number-three cause of premature aging is poor sleep position), take off makeup at night and use good-quality products with the best raw ingredients. Home care matters as much as in-office does.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Scalpels are becoming yesterday\u2019s news\u2014even in Tinseltown. The latest and greatest is the SculpSure machine, which uses a regulated light-based technology to disrupt and destroy adipose tissue. It is newly FDA-approved and it is the highest tech laser treatment for a fully non-invasive treatment of lipolysis for the flanks and abdomen. What is amazing about this is it is a one-treatment procedure. Maybe in some cases two. Within a few weeks results are complete and no downtime whatsoever. Basically, the result is like you have had a little liposuction when there is nothing invasive about it. Just relax for 25 minutes and the light/heat technology will dissolve and eliminate even the most stubborn fatty deposits and tissue. This is probably the hottest treatment we have right now in the clinic.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another popular in-spa treatment is Emsculpt. This groundbreaking treatment uses High-Intensity Focused Electro-Magnetic (HIFEM) Technology. Each Emsculpt session is 30 minutes long and is equivalent to doing 20,000 crunches or squats.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think \u201cmaintain, not reclaim\u201d and always try to be preventative. Think of the rules of eating that are good for your body\u2014these apply to your skin as well. Be consistent with taking off your makeup, exfoliate regularly, manually or with a tool, and use high-quality skin care products with the best raw ingredients. Old school skin care was to use aggressive products that caused chemical cell turnover reaction, which can make you more susceptible to sun damage (Retin A is so 1980s). My opinion is to use retinol ingredients sparingly, or choose <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_EGF+Stem+Cell+Complex_66239.htm\">EGF</a> for cellular turnover instead.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">At-home devices are, to me, the future of beauty. Invest in a beauty tool that would help increase absorption of products, like my <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Instant+Uplift_66249.htm\">Uplift</a> or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Triangle+Facial+Beauty+Tool_73906.htm\">TriAngle</a>, which are much like the machines we use in-office. There\u2019s also the <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Beauty+Stamp_66248.htm\">Beauty Stamp</a>, which may very well be the best investment anyone can make. This small pad features a cross-section of microneedles that helps with micro-exfoliation, opens channels for product delivery and efficacy and aids in the body process of collagen and elastin production.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Another thing is to avoid side sleeping; it\u2019s the number-three cause of premature aging (number one is UV damage and number two is smoking). If you can, use one with a satin surface and train yourself to sleep on your back (or at least use <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Beauty+Bear+Age+Delay+Pillow+-+Midnight+Gray_66244.htm\">Beauty Bear</a>, which features an opening to protect your face).</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most women also tend to over exfoliate. We need to treat our skin like a silk fabric, not a piece of leather. When you over exfoliate (physically or chemically), it destroys the protective barrier that your skin has. Once removed or compromised, you are exposing your skin to environmental toxins, sun damage, premature aging and acne-causing bacteria.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lastly, wear your sunscreen\u2014this seems basic but every little thing helps.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong style=\"font-size: 14pt;\">What else is in the pipeline for Nurse Jamie? What are you working on right now?</strong></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I created my line for products that I felt were missing in the marketplace. As a busy working mom of triplets, I\u2019m proud to say that I\u2019m my own client. There are so many new and exciting products out there. The best part is that the better the technology, the more we can delay the need to go under the knife.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">I am always working on new products and investigating new raw ingredients so there will be more on the horizon for 2019. I believe that the future of beauty starts at home. We will continue to launch at-home beauty tools and products including the launch of Nurse Jamie Adaptogens, focusing on beauty-based nutrition.

From cleansers to serums to moisturizers and face masks, the skin staple has left its mark on a variety of formulas thanks to its \u201cwidespread properties and ability to regenerate the skin,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.mcleandermatologycenter.com/lily-talakoub-md/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Lily Talakoub</a>, a board-certified dermatologist at McClean Dermatology.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When we think about health, it\u2019s hard not to think about vitamin C. According to Dr. Zenhausern, it\u2019s considered \u201cone of the most powerful antioxidants\u201d for not only its contribution to our beauty but our wellness, too. \u201c[Vitamin C] boosts your immunity [to] prevent or treat a cold, aids in collagen formation, helps wounds heal quicker [and] also may help reduce the risk of heart disease,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along with boasting some major health benefits, vitamin C is also good for your skin.\u00a0In skin care, vitamin C is probably best known for its anti-aging benefits, as its antioxidant makeup basically exists to do away with pesky signs of aging. However, it\u2019s much more nitty gritty than that. \u201cVitamin C stimulates collagen production,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.drjaliman.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Debra Jaliman</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City, adding that collagen \u201cimproves the skin\u2019s texture and quality.\u201d Additionally, the skin superstar inhibits an enzyme called tyrosinase, which is responsible for \u201cconverting tyrosine into melanin, thus preventing hyperpigmentation,\u201d Jaliman adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Boosting collagen and preventing hyperpigmentation aren\u2019t its only superpowers. Under the umbrella of protection, vitamin C shines as one ingredient that can target a host of concerns related to sun damage and pollution. \u201cVitamin C not only helps repair free radical damage, but it brightens the skin and helps fade dark spots, [too],\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. On top of that, it can improve skin firmness \u201cwhich may help prevent fine lines,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The best part (aside from its vast beauty benefits, of course)? Unlike some other buzzworthy skin care ingredients, it doesn\u2019t come with a long list of precautions. \u201cVitamin C is generally safe, gentle and effective when used in skin care,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C might do the skin some good, but it also benefits the hair. The ingredient is important for hair health because it is a \u201cnecessary component to create the protein known as collagen,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.nmdwellnessofscottsdale.com/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Alissia Zenhausern</a>, NMD. \u201cVitamin C also helps your body absorb non-heme iron, a necessary mineral for hair growth,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, Dr. Zenhausern recommends getting adequate levels of vitamin C through your diet, as certain foods and even supplements can make a difference. \u201cWe often see the biggest benefit of supplementing vitamin C in patients with vitamin C deficiency,\u201d she explains. As for those without a deficiency, she recommends adding more parsley leaves, kale, broccoli, brussels sprouts, strawberries, kiwi and citrus fruits to your diet, as they are some of the best ways to reap the benefits of vitamin C for hair.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C might have made its way to every corner of skin care, but not every formula is created equal. \u201cWhen used in products that penetrate and hydrate the skin, it works very well,\u201d Dr. Jaliman confirms. If you\u2019re on the hunt for an effective vitamin C product, we\u2019ve got you covered with these top picks.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This vitamin C serum is one of those skin care products that can\u2019t be beat. Loved by editors and beauty fanatics alike, SkinCeuticals <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-superproduct-skinceuticals-c-e-ferulic/\">C E Ferulic</a> utilizes a unique blend of <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-ferulic-acid/\">ferulic acid</a> and vitamins C and E to protect the skin against environmental aggressors and prevent premature signs of aging like fine lines, wrinkles, dullness and even dark spots.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_C+E+Ferulic_5230.htm?keyword=5230\">SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Dr. Jaliman\u2019s advice, vitamin C formulas should be ultra-hydrating\u2014and this moisturizer from Sunday Riley checks that box. The formula features lime pearl extract, which retexturizes the complexion and allows the added vitamin C to better absorb. Additionally, it is also enhanced by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/turmeric-benefits-for-skin/\">turmeric</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/skin-benefits-of-chamomile/\">chamomile</a> to calm signs of redness.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Add a dose of vitamin C to your hair care regimen with these Power Drops from Oribe. The formula features vitamin C and quinoa protein to boost color retention, shield against UV rays and even reduce breakage. Adding a few drops of this hair product enhancer to your styling products or shampoo and conditioner can help promote a healthier \u2018do all around.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Power+Drops+Color+Preservation+Booster++2+Vitamin+C+Complex_77981.htm\">Oribe\u00a0Power Drops Color Preservation Booster \u2013 2% Vitamin C Complex</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to signs of aging, our eyes are typically a top concern. Luckily, reaching for an eye cream formula with vitamin C can help. In addition to vitamin C, this active eye cream from La Roche-Posay is enhanced with L-ascorbic acid to brighten the delicate skin around the eyes and citrus amara flower extract to boost circulation and soothe the skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Active+C+Eyes_1000.htm\">La Roche-Posay Active C Eyes</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C is found in all types of skin care products, but serum is where it\u2019s most popular. The RESIST C15 Super Booster from Paula\u2019s Choice combines powerful antioxidants such as ferulic acid, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-peptides-do-for-skin/\">peptides</a> and vitamins C and E for rejuvenation that leaves the skin looking and feeling more youthful with every use.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_C15+Super+Booster_54588.htm\">RESIST C15 Super Booster</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Vitamin C might protect against sun damage, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense. That\u2019s where this antioxidant-infused sunscreen from Supergoop! comes in handy. Enriched with vitamin C to neutralize free radicals, the mist formula uses SPF 50 to shield your skin from the sun and a touch of antioxidant power to nourish and protect.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking to up the ante on your vitamin C intake <em>and </em>feel a boost of energy, the Uber Energy supplements from HUM Nutrition are a must-try. The capsules contain a blend of vitamin C, as well as L-tyrosine and rhodiola rosea, which help combat feelings of fatigue. On top of that, they\u2019re also enhanced by <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-gotu-kola/\">gotu kola</a> for mental clarity and vitamins B5 and B6 for energy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Try:\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/product_Uber+Energy_68054.htm\">HUM Nutrition Uber Energy</a></strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You don\u2019t need a ton of steps in your skin care regimen to reap the benefits of vitamin C. In fact, all you need is a good moisturizer enhanced with the ingredient. Natura Bisse\u2019s C+C Vitamin Summer Lotion was made with sun-kissed skin in mind with a formula chock-full of hydrating, brightening and soothing ingredients like <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/aloe-vera-benefits-skin-hair/\">aloe vera</a>, essential oils and\u2014of course\u2014vitamin C.</p>"},

Exfoliation lies among the best ways to improve your skin\u2019s texture and tone, and it\u2019s something all of us can do right at home. However, it\u2019s also really easy to overdo it by exfoliating too often or using the wrong method for your skin type. Learn how to properly exfoliate your skin\u00a0from head to toe with this guide.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Exfoliating the skin is the process of removing dead cells from the outer layer of your skin using an exfoliant, which could either be a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Cleansers+and+Exfoliators_503724.htm\">chemical and physical exfoliant</a>. There are a couple of ways to physically exfoliate. The first involves using a\u00a0skin care tool, such as a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/konjac-sponge-the-easiest-and-cutest-way-to-exfoliate-your-skin/\">sponge, towel or brush</a>, on your skin to displace and remove dead skin cells. The other method involves using a liquid, gel or scrub with granules like microbeads\u00a0or sugar to smooth and refine the skin.\u00a0With chemical exfoliation, alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs), beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) or enzymes are used to loosen the glue-like substance that holds dead skin cells together so they are easily removed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Your skin is constantly repairing and replacing itself. Because of this, you can be left with layers upon layers of dead skin all over your body. Exfoliating helps rid your body of these leftover dead skin cells, revealing healthier, brighter skin immediately after.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While brighter skin is certainly a perk, exfoliation can actually help improve the health of your skin as well.\u00a0If your skin is riddled with dead cells, your skin care products may not be able to penetrate deep into the skin and do their work.\u00a0By removing the top-most layer of skin, you\u2019re making it easier for your topical skin treatments to sink deep\u00a0below the surface where they could make a difference.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have acne-prone skin, exfoliation can help clear out clogged pores that often lead to breakouts. It can also help fade acne scars faster by accelerating skin cell turnover and stimulating collagen production.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When using a physical exfoliant, start by washing your face with your regular cleanser. Then, take a quarter-size amount of your face scrub and apply it onto your face in circular motions, avoiding the eye area. Gently massage the product onto the skin for as long as your specific product recommends, usually from 30 seconds to a full minute. Then, rinse off with warm water and gently pat your skin with a clean towel.\u00a0Follow with your hydrating mask, serum or cream.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When using a chemical exfoliant, wash your face with your regular cleanser. If your chemical exfoliant comes in a pre-moistened cloth or pad, apply this all over your entire face, neck, d\u00e9collet\u00e9 and even the tops of your hands.\u00a0Allow a few minutes for a chemical exfoliant to be completely absorbed into the skin before moving on to the next step in your regimen, which may be a treatment serum or cream. Do the same for exfoliants in forms of gels or serums. Some types of chemical exfoliants, often called \u201cpeels,\u201d are used similar to a mask application and are required to be rinsed off after a few minutes. Always check your product label to make sure you\u2019re using it correctly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Remember that exfoliating your face should only be done about one to three times a week, as exfoliating too often or too hard may cause micro-tears on your skin\u2019s surface and strip your skin\u2019s protective layer. If you have inflammatory acne, rosacea or hypersensitive skin, ask your dermatologist to determine what exfoliant to use and how often to use it.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/79378iiFp8A\" width=\"750\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff</span></iframe></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One way to exfoliate your body is with a warm\u00a0shower and a loofah, sponge or washcloth. However, you can find both chemical and physical exfoliating body washes to really soak in the benefits of exfoliation\u2014while making your shower time a little more spa-like. For chemical exfoliation, consider using a\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Exfoliating+Body+Wash_472.htm\">body wash that contains glycolic acid</a>\u00a0concentrate and use it as you would your regular body wash. For physical exfoliation, gently massage the body scrub of your choice in circular motions to eliminate dead skin cells. Let it sit for a minute and rinse off.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bottoms of your feet tend to be home to the roughest spots of skin on your body, so they require a little more TLC when it comes to exfoliating. If you\u2019ve gotten a pedicure before, you know that physical exfoliation\u2014scrubs, stones and files\u2014can be an effective way to smooth rough heels. Your feet can also benefit from chemical exfoliation, which is what powers the cult-favorite\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/how-to-get-soft-feet-baby-foot-peel/\">exfoliating socks from Baby Foot</a>. All you have to do is soak your feet for an hour, while your feet absorb the glycolic, malic and lactic acids. Then, within a few days, your feet will start to shed a layer of skin, revealing baby-soft feet.</p>"},

But this powerhouse product does so much more than that. In addition to providing a healthy dose of hydration, this oil also helps improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of pores with its chlorophyllin-copper complex and boost radiance with the antioxidant turmeric. </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For best results, warm a few drops of the Lancer Skincare Omega Hydrating Oil in your hands before spreading generously over your face and neck.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional-level results come from potent ingredients\u2014and there are few products packed with as many potent ingredients as the SkinCeuticals C E Ferulic.

Thanks to the addition of activated binchotan charcoal, this powerful exfoliant also absorbs environmental pollutants, offering an extra layer of protection that will keep skin looking and feeling its best.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For best results, pour a half-teaspoon of the Daily Superfoliant powder into wet hands and rub hands together until the powder transforms into a paste. Apply the paste in circular motions to the skin, avoiding eyes, for one minute before rinsing with water. Follow up with the rest of your skin care routine, including sunscreen.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cleansing is a critical step in any skin care routine.

As if that weren\u2019t enough, this gel formula is lightweight and works with every skin tone. Use it to cleanse your skin, remove makeup, treat a breakout or get a clean shave. The sky\u2019s the limit with this nourishing cleanser.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For best results, use AM and PM.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the reasons people love getting their skin professionally treated is the instant change they see in their skin. But if it\u2019s instant results you\u2019re looking for, you don\u2019t need to go to the treatment room\u2014all you need is the Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta Extra Strength Daily Peel.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This resurfacing face peel treatment addresses a host of skin care issues, including hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, premature aging, fine lines and wrinkles, free radical damage, enlarged pores\u2026just about every skin care concern under the sun.

Additionally, it\u2019s one of those skin conditions that \u201ccan\u2019t be cured but can be treated\u201d with proper care\u2014aka, a targeted skin care routine and a touch of plant magic.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To up the ante on your rosacea skin care regimen, keep your eyes peeled for essential oils that help reduce puffiness, irritation and redness. Luckily, they aren\u2019t hard to come by and are already featured in many skin care formulas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here\u2019s a look at the best essential oils for rosacea and how to use them to improve the look of your skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although they have existed for hundreds of years, essential oils have only recently made it into the mainstream like never before. Thanks to natural skin care and a particular uptick in diffuser sales, these botanicals have made their way into our everyday arsenal. But, you don\u2019t have to go full-fledged DIY to reap the benefits of essential oils for rosacea. In fact, many skin care formulas already contain essential oils, making it easier to incorporate them into your beauty routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to purchasing products made with the best essential oils for rosacea, you can incorporate the actual oils into your regimen, too. Dr. Jaliman recommends adding a few drops to your favorite moisturizer to \u201cthoroughly penetrate the skin.\u201d Essential oils can also be added to a homemade face mask, or to a facial oil to double up on benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because an essential oil is natural doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t irritate your skin. \u201cSome essential oils can be a bit stronger than others,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman. \u201cYou should always check which essential oil you should dilute,\u201d she explains. You can dilute essential oils by mixing a few drops into a carrier oil such as almond, avocado, hemp, or <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-coconut-oil-skin-hair/\">coconut oil</a>. \u201cYou can use many essential oils in conjunction with creams and moisturizers, [too],\u201d adds Dr. Jaliman. As with any new product, test a small patch on your skin (preferably on the inside of your wrist to avoid irritation on your complexion) before slathering on a homemade concoction or store-bought product.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you experience rosacea, Dr. Jaliman recommends booking an appointment with your dermatologist before diving into the world of essential oils to treat this condition. A professional can help you better determine the severity and come up with a game plan to alleviate symptoms.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you want to incorporate essential oils into your rosacea-specific skin care regimen, consider the following botanicals found in your favorite skin care products.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tea tree is one of the more popular essential oils in skin care and is often a go-to for those with acne-prone skin. However, if you experience rosacea, the natural elixir might help ease some common symptoms. \u201cTea tree oil is great because it has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. It [also] helps soothe redness and inflammation,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_SATURN+Sulfur+Acne+Treatment+Mask+_75097.htm\">Sunday Riley SATURN Sulfur Acne Treatment Mask</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rosacea-prone skin can often look and feel dry, which is why a moisturizing essential oil like rosehip can be key. \u201cRosehip oil not only has hydrating properties but it can also promote skin regeneration and can improve skin texture,\u201d Dr. Jaliman explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Rosehip+Whip+Moisturizer_9563.htm\">Eminence Organic Skin Care Rosehip Whip Moisturizer</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Redness can be one of the most frustrating things about rosacea. Luckily, you can improve the look of it with the use of certain essential oils like rosemary, which \u201chelps heal skin and reduce redness,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_HydraIntensive+Cooling+Masque_73551.htm\">iS Clinical Hydra-Intensive Cooling Masque</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Evening Primrose is another essential oil with rosacea skin benefits, as it is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (a fatty acid found primarily in vegetable oils). \u201cThis oil improves the health of skin [and] has anti-inflammatory properties,\u201d notes Dr. Jaliman.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Moisture+Renewal+Oil+Booster_62269.htm\">Paula\u2019s Choice Moisture Oil Booster</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we have a hard time sleeping, we often add a few drops of lavender to our diffuser. However, relaxation isn\u2019t the only benefit of lavender essential oil. \u201cLavender is particularly good for people with redness due to rosacea and it helps brighten the skin,\u201d says Dr. Jaliman. Additionally, it has \u201cexceptional anti-inflammatory and antiseptic properties\u201d and \u201csoothes and nourishes the skin,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in: </strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Gentle+Cream+Exfoliant_498.htm\">Dermalogica Gentle Cream Exfoliant </a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Along with redness, puffiness is another common sign of rosacea, so choosing an essential oil that can help target this symptom can make a big difference. Dr. Jaliman says to give products with cypress a try as it \u201chelps with redness and inflammation associated with rosacea.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Find it in:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/product_Emulsion+Pure_41853.htm\">Yon-Ka Emulsion Pure</a></p>"},

Think again! The truth of the matter is that the majority of the UV damage we receive isn\u2019t always from spending an entire day at the beach. It\u2019s from your day-to-day activities\u2014driving in a car during daylight, for instance\u2014or during winter when sun protection is likely the last thing on your mind. And if you\u2019re hitting the slopes this season,\u00a0your risk of burning becomes even greater.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to <a href=\"http://www.skincancer.org/\">The Skin Cancer Foundation</a>, \u201cUV radiation exposure increases 4 to 5 percent with every 1,000 feet above sea level.\u201d This means that the higher your altitude, the higher your risk of sun-induced skin\u00a0damage. And because snow reflects up to 80 percent of the UV light from the sun, you are often hit by the same rays twice!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To keep your skin protected, experts advise to <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/sunscreen-myths-debunked/\">use sunscreen all year round</a> (yes, even during colder months!). Make sure you\u2019re using <a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">a broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> with an SPF of at least 30, higher if you\u2019re at the beach or the mountains. And remember, no matter how high the SPF, the FDA recommends reapplying sunscreen every two hours for optimal protection. For the best sunscreens to use for winter and all year round, we\u2019ve collated our favorites below!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>This sunscreen is not only the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/most-searched-on-dermstore-2017/\">most searched sunscreen</a> on Dermstore, it\u2019s also one of our <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/most-reviewed-beauty-products/\">top-reviewed products</a>!

I apply it every day under my makeup. It\u2019s very lightweight and not greasy at all.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>If you\u2019re looking for sun protection of the highest power, you can\u2019t go wrong with SkinCeuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense Sunscreen. With a broad-spectrum formula, an <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/what-is-spf-50/\">SPF of 50</a> and water resistance for up to 40 minutes, this powerful sunscreen will not disappoint. Bonus? It has a sheer, universally flattering tint that makes wearing foundation almost unnecessary.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Shoppers Say: </strong>\u201cThis sunscreen is awesome. It is light and covers my skin imperfections at the same time. I use it faithfully and most of the time wear it and nothing else.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>For those struggling with fine lines and wrinkles, this\u00a0 sunscreen is ideal.\u00a0Rich in emollients, this daily lotion with an SPF of 50 fortifies your natural barrier with peptides and hyaluronic acid, targeting early signs of aging as it protects your skin against further damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Shoppers Say: </strong>\u201cIt is not heavy, but it keeps my skin fully hydrated all day. The SPF 50 is a bonus as I\u2019m not one to remember to use sunscreen and I\u2019m outside most of the time.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>If you\u2019re not a fan of the gooey, white texture of most sunscreens, this weightless, scentless and oil-free formula is absolutely colorless, giving your skin a clear, matte surface that\u2019s ready for makeup. Aside from UVA and UVB, this sunscreen also protects from blue and infrared light.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Shoppers Say: </strong>\u201cThis sunscreen is clear, not white and goes on so smoothly!

I love how smooth and glowing it leaves my skin.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Great for: </strong>A Dose of Vitamin C</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>This sunscreen packs a punch with SPF 30 and a dose of vitamin C for a sun-kissed complexion, sans the damage. Rich in antioxidants, vitamin C not only helps shield the skin from environmental aggressors but can also smooth out the look of fine lines, wrinkles and other premature signs of aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Great for: </strong>A Quick Re-Touch</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Re-applying sunscreen over makeup can be a bit of a hassle, which is why we prefer this mineral powder with SPF 45 instead. Enriched with titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, along with skin-benefiting ingredients like vitamins C and E, this brush-on formula helps reduce the look of mid-day shine and protects against sun damage.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>What Shoppers Say: </strong>\u201cI wear sunscreen daily and purchased this with the intention to touch up in the middle of the day. It\u2019s great! Great texture and coverage.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why We Love It: </strong>Shopping for a sunscreen for your body can be just as tricky as finding the right face SPF.

How are you supposed to know if a sunscreen will hydrate your dry skin or prevent your acne-prone skin from breaking out? Enter EltaMD, a sunscreen brand beloved by dermatologists and known for its effective sunscreens that work for a variety of skin types and concerns.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What sets EltaMD\u2019s sunscreens apart from others out there is the formulations. \u201cThey all have a basis in zinc as the primary UV protectant,\u201d says Larry MacPhee, EltaMD\u2019s general manager. \u201cWe believe very strongly in the use of zinc because it\u2019s a physical sunscreen blocker so not being a chemical, the product won\u2019t erode due to exposure to UV light.\u201d Zinc sits on top of the skin to create a physical shield against the sun. MacPhee adds that in many instances, zinc is used for skin care treatments and is beneficial for damaged or sensitive skin (unlike chemical UV blockers, which are absorbed into the skin and can be sensitizing).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond using zinc, EltaMD\u2019s formulas are cosmetically elegant, meaning application is a breeze. \u201cCosmetic elegance underscores our products so that they have a relatively easy rub in,\u201d says MacPhee. \u201cEven when formulated with titanium or other UV ingredients, they are able to rub completely into virtually any skin type. This allows a protectant that is as powerful as zinc and can be used by anyone.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This all being said, choosing a sunscreen shouldn\u2019t be a one-size-fits-all approach. Everyone\u2019s skin has different needs, and what works best for one person may not necessarily be the best option for someone else. For example, someone who breaks out regularly may benefit from an oil-free, non-comedogenic formula, while someone who has dry, flaky skin may want to look for hydrating ingredients that provide added moisture in addition to sun protection.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When choosing the right sunscreen for your skin type, consider the following three factors:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Skin type: </strong>Your first step in choosing a sunscreen should be thinking about your skin type. \u201cDo you suffer from acne; do you have rosacea or eczema?\u201d asks MacPhee. \u201cTaking these kinds of things into skin type are very important considerations.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Do you work outside all day? Do you like to play sports? Do you live by the ocean? \u201cThese lifestyle choices direct the kind of sunscreen that you should be using,\u201d says MacPhee.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Geography: </strong>Where you live should factor into your decision too. \u201cIf you live in the mountains of Colorado where your sun exposure is huge because you\u2019re a mile up in the sky and the amount of sun you would receive there exceeds the amount of sun received in Florida, for example,\u201d explains MacPhee.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now you\u2019re ready to find your EltaMD sunscreen match! Here, get the lowdown on every EltaMD sunscreen and find out which one suits your needs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why it\u2019s great: </strong>No more white cast here: goes on completely clear, as it utilizes transparent zinc oxide for sun protection. Plus, it fights acne while it protects your skin against damaging UVA and UVB rays, thanks to the pore-refining and shine-reducing lactic acid in its formula.<br>\n<strong>Key Ingredients:</strong> Niacinamide, lactic acid, hyaluronic acid, vitamin E, zinc oxide<br>\n<strong>SPF: </strong>46<br>\n<strong>Tinted?: </strong>Untinted<br>\n<strong>Oil-Free?: </strong>Yes<br>\n<strong>Water-Resistant?: </strong>No<br>\n<strong>Great for Skin Type/Concern: </strong>Acne-prone, hyperpigmentation, rosacea<br>\n<strong>What shoppers say: </strong>\u201cSunscreen is light and blends easy!

The skin, like every organ in the body, performs its best within a narrow ideal environment, especially when it comes to pH. Skin maintains its barrier best around 5.5\u2014slightly acidic. At the ideal pH (5.5), the skin is able to maintain a good barrier and, together with natural oils, moisturizers and bacteria, function as a true protective defense organ. This collection of factors creating this shield is called the \u201cacid mantle.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Nazarian:\u00a0</strong>Any great deviation\u2014either too high of a pH or too low\u2014throws off the \u201cecosystem\u201d of skin and causes<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/anti-inflammation-skin-supplements/\"> inflammation and irritation</a> when the natural oils and natural bacteria on the skin are disrupted. The connection between pH and bacteria comes from shifting the pH so far in either direction that the \u201cgood\u201d bacteria are no longer able to keep inflammation and \u201cbad\u201d bacteria in check.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Nazarian:\u00a0</strong>When people complain that their skin is too red, too dry, too itchy, too flaky, too oily\u2014too anything\u2014it\u2019s potentially because the ideal balance of the skin is off and the pH has shifted, creating a cascade of inflammatory factors and unevenness in the natural flora. Although the concept of pH balance is still being extensively studied, the thought is that a pH that is too alkaline causes drying and decreased hydration of skin, leading to eczema flares and potentially highlighting signs of aging (like fine lines, wrinkles), while skin ranging too far low on the acidic pH spectrum creates increased redness and inflammation. The same is also possible internally: We have natural bacterial flora that helps boost the immune system and helps minimize bad bacteria. When we throw off this sensitive balance, newer studies suggest that inflammatory markers in the colon (and skin) increase, triggering acne, rosacea and perhaps other inflammatory conditions of the skin. Any deviation prevents skin from looking, feeling and performing its best.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Nazarian:\u00a0</strong>The skin\u2019s pH can be impacted by nearly anything: the skin care products you use, what you\u2019re washing it with (classic soaps are too alkaline), how often you\u2019re washing it and even what you\u2019re eating. Similarly (and more commonly), if you\u2019re using products that are too acidic or too basic, you could alter the skin\u2019s pH. Patients of mine are always looking for \u201chome remedies\u201d or Pinterest-type skin care tips to naturally address skin concerns, but this is extremely risky because most home products, like kitchen and bathroom items, have a pH far varied from that of skin.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Dr. Nazarian:\u00a0</strong><a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-of-probiotics-for-skin/\">Probiotics can help restore the balance of skin</a> and bacteria both externally and internally, but it\u2019s important to adhere to a good topical regimen and diet to decrease the disruption of the good bacterial flora and pH as well. Many topical skin care products today contain probiotics or state that they are pH balanced: Both of these techniques will help regain an ideal skin environment. In addition, remembering to treat your skin delicately (not overwashing, overscrubbing or using random products) will help prevent the destruction of the sensitive acid mantle and will help protect your skin so it can protect you.</p>"},

Unfortunately, rosacea is a\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/skinhealthcenter/article_7-Common-Myths-About-Rosacea-Debunked_1922.htm\">poorly understood skin condition</a>; its cause hasn\u2019t exactly been determined and there is no known cure as of this moment.\u00a0</span>\u201cRosacea is still not fully understood,\u201d explains board-certified dermatologist Ashley Magovern. \u201cBut we do know that people with rosacea have increased levels of inflammatory proteins called cathelicidins in their skin, which contribute to the redness, dilated vessels and the red inflammatory bumps that we see in patients with this condition. The tendency toward rosacea is most likely genetic, but environmental and lifestyle factors absolutely play a role too.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">While treatments for rosacea are seldom permanent, the good news is that there are things you can do to alleviate symptoms. Here, Dr. Magovern share some tips on how to address redness and take care of your skin if you have this condition.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you suspect you have rosacea, the first step is to talk to your dermatologist to get a clear diagnosis and to discuss your treatment options. Luckily, with today\u2019s technology, rosacea symptoms can be controlled or lessened using over-the-counter products or in-office procedures. \u201cThere are some amazing over-the-counter treatments available today. I think the confusion is how to use them,\u201d Dr. Magovern says. \u201cIf you are not seeing improvement and are still flaring despite using your OTC regimen for six to eight weeks, I would make an appointment with a dermatologist and discuss other options,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For those with more severe symptoms, Dr. Magovern recommends going beyond prescription products and considering lasers that target redness and inflammation, as well as light treatments\u2014like IPL (intense pulsed light), BBL (broadband light) and PDT (photodynamic therapy). \u201cThese treatments can work wonders for patients with rosacea and redness. They really help give long-lasting improvement and can really help normalize the skin. Some patients can stop using their OTC or prescription products after a series of laser treatments,\u201d she explains.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you\u2019re using prescription medications or undergoing a laser treatment for rosacea, building a solid skin care regimen should be part of your treatment plan. \u201cSkin care is absolutely essential and totally underrated in my opinion. If you don\u2019t take care of your skin, <em>especially</em> in those that have rosacea with an inherent barrier and inflammatory issue, the skin will only get worse as time goes on,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cRosacea is a chronic condition. Cumulative sun damage, environmental damage and aging will take its toll and the skin will not be able to compensate for the damage as well as someone who takes care of their skin and the skin barrier,\u201d she notes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here are Dr. Magovern\u2019s skin care tips:</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">\u201cRosacea patients are often hesitant to put anything on their skin,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cBut even if you have rosacea and your skin may be sensitive, it\u2019s very important to use skin care products.\u00a0Skin care is like exercise; you shouldn\u2019t really stop. Once your condition improves, we can tweak it and recommend different products, but stopping is not an option.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for which products you should use, Dr. Magovern suggests going above cleansing and moisturizing. \u201cIn this day and age, it\u2019s probably not enough to just cleanse and moisturize with bland products.\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">The goal would be to push your regimen in order to find products that can actually help your skin become more healthy over time. For example, products that will help decrease inflammation, fight free-radical damage and boost collagen production,\u201d she says. \u201c</span>For your regimen, I would say to use a cleanser that protects the skin barrier, an anti-inflammatory/antioxidant serum or lotion, a barrier repair moisturizer to\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">keep chemical and mechanical irritants out</span>\u2014and of course sunscreen.\u201d</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Dr. Magovern also recommends keeping your skin care routine simple and reading your product labels carefully.\u00a0\u201cSimple is always better,\u201d she says. \u201cTry to limit the amount of products and the amount of ingredients you put on your skin.\u201d</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Another piece of advice? Look for products that are\u00a0specifically formulated for redness-prone or sensitive skin,\u00a0as these products usually help calm and soothe the skin and help protect the skin barrier. \u201c</span><span class=\"s1\">I prefer products with anti-inflammatory or anti-redness ingredients that can also strengthen the skin barrier, like niacinamide. Other anti-inflammatory ingredients to look for include allantoin, licorice extract, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/benefits-of-matcha/\">green tea</a> and\u00a0resveratrol. Moisturizers with ceramides are key, in my opinion.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just because you have sensitive skin doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t use other products with potent ingredients like retinol and hydroxy acids. Just make sure you\u2019re using them correctly and sparingly. Here are a few dos and don\u2019ts from Dr. Magovern:</p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">As if we didn\u2019t mention this enough, sunscreen use, according to Dr. Magovern, is non-negotiable. \u201cThe pathogenesis of rosacea may not be fully understood yet, but we know that cumulative sun damage plays a role,\u201d she says. \u201cSunscreen use will not only help prevent the condition in susceptible patients, but it will also help prevent flare-ups in those who struggle with it.\u201d She also mentions that p</span><span class=\"s1\">eople with sensitive skin tend to gravitate toward 100% mineral sunscreens.\u00a0\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"p1\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Every patient is different, and while we know that\u00a0certain things trigger rosacea\u00a0in general, some may find a specific cause. \u201cSun, heat, wind, exercise,\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.dermstore.com/blog/white-wine-and-rosacea/\">alcohol</a>\u00a0and stress are common triggers,\u201d says Dr. Magovern. \u201cBut some report that a specific fruit, vegetable, meat or dairy product will cause a flare.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span class=\"s1\">Aside from finding your triggers and avoiding them as much as possible, Dr. Magovern also recommends eating right and taking supplements that can improve your overall health. \u201cEating a non-inflammatory diet rich in antioxidant-containing foods, good fats and oils can have a big impact on your skin and your overall health.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to build your skin care regimen?

We spoke to <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/author/dr-heather-d-rogers/\">board-certified dermatologist Dr. Heather D. Rogers</a>\u00a0to unpack what the news really means for your sun care routine.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First things first: No one should stop using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and premature aging. We know sunscreens are effective at minimizing UV damage. We also already know that chemical sunscreens are absorbed by the skin, Dr. Rogers says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t new information.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What <em>wasn\u2019t</em> known before this new study was how much of these ingredients absorb into the body when used according to the maximum limits of the products\u2019 directions. The study\u2019s participants applied sunscreen over 75% of their bodies four times a day, for four days in a row\u2014essentially the amount you\u2019d use over the course of a beach vacation if you\u2019re being diligent about your protection. Until now, this level of usage hadn\u2019t been studied.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study found that the levels of sunscreen ingredients that accumulated in the subjects\u2019 bloodstreams exceeded the FDA\u2019s previously recommended limits. But it didn\u2019t say this is necessarily unsafe. \u201cThere\u2019s no clear data showing these chemicals are bad for us,\u201d Dr. Rogers explains. \u201cWe just know now that the amount we\u2019re being exposed to is higher than previously thought.\u201d The researchers\u2019 conclusion? That more research is needed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ingredients studied\u2014oxybenzone, avobenzone, octocrylene and ecamsule\u2014are among the most widely used actives in <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/mineral-sunscreen-vs-chemical-sunscreen/\">chemical sunscreens</a>, which work differently than physical or mineral sunscreens.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cChemical sunscreens work by penetrating the skin and absorbing and breaking down UV below the skin\u2019s surface,\u201d explains Patricia Boland, Vice President of Research and Development at Colorescience, who has been developing formulations for nearly two decades. \u201cMineral (aka physical) SPF ingredients like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide work by sitting on top of the skin and scattering and reflecting the UV.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Colorescience_500030.htm\">Colorescience</a> uses exclusively physical sunscreens in their products.)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While chemical sunscreens tend to be more lightweight and transparent on skin, physical blockers are a good alternative if you\u2019re concerned about absorption. Dr. Rogers has been a proponent of mineral-based formulas even before the new study. \u201cZinc oxide and titanium dioxide actually provide better sun protection from a broader UV wavelength,\u201d she says.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The downside to physical sunscreens is the white cast some formulas can leave on skin. \u201cI tell [my patients] that there are pros and cons to everything, and finding a good sunscreen is like finding a pair of jeans that you love,\u201d Dr. Rogers says. \u201cFor some people, physical sunscreens really block their pores and feel heavy on their skin. For that group, if they want to use chemical sunscreen on their face, that\u2019s very different than applying a chemical sunscreen to their body four times a day for a week.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And not all chemical sunscreen actives are created equal. Oxybenzone, one of the four ingredients examined in the recent study, was found to absorb into the body at a rate 50 to 100 times higher than the other three chemicals. Hawaii has banned state sales of sunscreens containing oxybenzone because of concerns that the ingredient\u2019s presence in waterways may contribute to the bleaching of coral reefs (the state banned the ingredient octinoxate for the same reason). And some sunscreen manufacturers, such as <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Supergoop_501690.htm\">Supergoop!</a>, avoid using oxybenzone in their formulas. The FDA has not declared oxybenzone to be unsafe; it\u2019s been used for decades in sunscreens, and no studies to date have found it causes any adverse effects in humans. The bottom line? Your ingredient preferences are a personal choice, but protecting your skin from the sun is still a must.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The FDA has called on manufacturers to do more testing on their sunscreens, just as other drugs that are absorbed into the skin must be tested and shown to be safe. And if more research leads to better formulas, it can only be a good thing for everyone\u2019s skin. Until then, stay protected with the <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/profile_Face+Sun+Care_501201.htm\">broad-spectrum sunscreen</a> that works best for you.</p>"},

We Investigate.</h1>", "author": "<p class=\"postDetails\">BY Janeca Racho \u00b7 June 20, 2019</p>", "content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unless you are a wilderness-loving recluse or have found yourself in a spot with shoddy reception, there\u2019s a good chance that you spend a significant chunk of your everyday life staring at a screen. And while digital eye strain is enough reason for you to take your screen time down a notch, there is another potential risk you need to consider before you post that tenth (or fiftieth) selfie for the day or stream your latest Netflix obsession. And no, we\u2019re not just talking about going way past your data limit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As it turns out, the blue light emitted by TV screens, computers and other digital devices can also harm your skin and\u2014just like UVA and UVB rays\u2014may cause premature skin aging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">High-energy visible (HEV) light or blue light is a high-frequency, short-wave light in the violet/blue band with wavelengths that range from 400 to 450 nanometers, explains New York City board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"https://www.drhadleyking.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hadley King</a>. It accounts for 50 percent of the sunlight spectrum and is the only part of light that is visible to the naked eye. The majority of our exposure to blue light is caused by the sun, but it\u2019s also emitted by devices like smartphones, tablets and televisions along with fluorescent and LED bulbs from indoor lighting, adds Dr. King.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/should-you-be-worried-about-blue-light\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American Academy of Ophthalmology</a>, natural exposure to blue light (from sunlight) during the day can stimulate alertness, improve memory and elevate your mood. At night, however, staring at your laptop or e-book reader before bedtime can <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535358\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disrupt your body\u2019s circadian rhythm</a>, making it harder to get a good night\u2019s rest.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While blue light has been proven to affect your body\u2019s natural sleep-wake cycle, the jury is still out as far as determining the extent of its effects on your skin. \u201cWe are still learning about its cellular effects on the skin, but a couple of small studies appear to show that exposure to blue light can increase the production of free radicals in the skin and result in increased pigment, redness and possibly, premature aging,\u201d explains board-certified plastic surgeon and holistic beauty doctor <a href=\"http://www.dryoun.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anthony Youn</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">One such <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28315451\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study</a> conducted in 2017 shows that\u2014like ultraviolet rays\u2014blue light contributes to the formation of free radicals and \u201cinduce oxidative stress in live skin.\u201d \u201cThese free radicals cause skin cells to produce enzymes that break down collagen and elastin in the skin,\u201d adds Dr. King. It can also penetrate deeper into the skin, damaging essential proteins and resulting in wrinkles and loss of firmness. Similar research has shown evidence that exposure to HEV or blue light can <a href=\"https://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022-202X(15)33849-5/fulltext\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">delay skin barrier recovery</a> and result in <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24888214\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more significant hyperpigmentation</a> when compared to UVB rays.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to HEV emitted by smartphones and other similar devices, conclusive data is yet to be presented as to whether your selfie habit is to blame for those newly sprouted lines and dark spots. That said, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6280109/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a 2018 study</a> did show that even short-term exposure to blue light from electronic devices can \u201cincrease the generation of reactive oxygen species\u201d as skin is a primary target of oxidative stress.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Keep in mind, however, that although experts are still debating whether blue light truly wreaks havoc on your skin, texting and trawling Instagram feeds well into the night can still have negative effects on your overall eye and body health.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It\u2019s also important to note that while HEV light can be potentially harmful, it can also be harnessed to benefit your skin\u2014particularly if you\u2019re dealing with acne. \u201cBlue light therapy has been shown to kill acne-causing bacteria. Lightwave is one such blue light therapy that is pain-free and uses high-end LEDs to distribute specific visible wavelengths of light to the problem areas,\u201d explains New York City board-certified dermatologist <a href=\"http://www.drjaliman.com/debra-jaliman-md.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Debra Jaliman</a>, assistant professor of dermatology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai<em>. </em>\u201cIt can help those who have lesions that become inflamed and result in red and/or tender bumps, which can be filled with pus and bacteria,\u201d she adds.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Reducing your exposure to blue light is the easiest way to spare your skin (and body) from its unwanted side effects. Here are some tips from Dr. King:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When it comes to skin care, <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/best-spf-sunscreens/\">sunscreen remains your best defense</a> against photo-aging. However, it also pays to make room in your skin care routine for products that counter blue light side effects\u2014especially if you consider the fact that your exposure to HEV light continues long after the sun has set and tends to be more up close. It is even more important if you\u2019re dealing with rosacea and other skin conditions that flare up when exposed to the sun.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cThe chemicals and pigments used to filter UVA and UVB do not filter HEV light. Therefore, look for products that contain antioxidants to help protect against oxidative stress,\u201d suggests Dr. King. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide also work best, says Dr. Jaliman, particularly those that are infused with powerful anti-aging ingredients like niacinamide and <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/hyaluronic-acid/\">hyaluronic acid</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u201cAntioxidants licochalcone A and glycyrrhetinic acid have been shown to work together to protect skin cells in the deeper epidermal layers from sun-induced damage. Clinical research has shown that sunscreens containing licochalcone A offer effective and extended protection from HEV light in addition to UV,\u201d adds Dr. King.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of their potency and high concentration of active ingredients, serums also provide an important countermeasure against free radicals generated by blue light. \u201cUse of topical antioxidants (like serums and moisturizers), such as <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/top_ten/beauty-benefits-of-vitamin-c/\">vitamins C</a> and E, is a great way to prevent the effects of blue light from aging and damaging your skin,\u201d says Dr. Youn.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ready to add blue light protection to your daily skin care routine? Here are our top picks for best products that keep blue light\u2013induced skin-aging at bay.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Infused with a potent blend of antioxidants, coenzyme Q10 and skin-restoring ingredients\u2014including cacao seed extract, alteromonas ferment extract and bioflavonoids\u2014this anti-aging dynamic duo provides the ultimate defense against free radicals and blue light damage. The LUMIVIVE\u2122 Day Damage Defense Serum protects skin from HEV light and pollution, while the LUMIVIVE\u2122 Night Revitalize Repair Complex rejuvenates and detoxifies the skin while reversing the effects of environmental damage such as redness, discoloration and uneven skin tone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is definitely more to love about <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/lilikoi-eminence-organics-review/\">lilikoi</a> than its quirky sounding name.

Who wants their skin to suffer the consequences of endless amounts of trial and error? Luckily, there is now a variety of moisturizers formulated for those specifically with sensitive skin, with benefits that go beyond hydration.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin sensitivity varies by person and can be triggered by something as simple as a beauty product, environmental factors or a bigger skin condition. \u201cSensitive skin describes a number of skin conditions, from irritation to dry skin to rosacea,\u201d says Marina Peredo MD, FAAD. \u201cWhat they all have in common is inflammation, which occurs when the skin\u2019s outer barrier layer is damaged, often through a lack of hydration, overexposure to the sun, or contact with irritants such as harsh soaps, detergents or gels.\u201d If you\u2019re noticing redness on the skin, but are unsure if it classifies as sensitive, it\u2019s best to see a dermatologist to pinpoint the condition.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to taking care of sensitive skin, the right moisturizer goes a long way. \u201cMoisturizing regularly is the best thing you can do to calm sensitive skin,\u201d says Peredo, because it helps strengthen your skin\u2019s protective moisture barrier. Typically your skin absorbs water, but when water passes through the skin\u2019s surface (called</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> transepidermal water loss), your moisture barrier gets compromised, making your skin more sensitive and dry. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dehydrated skin has lost its barrier of protection,\u201d says board-certified dermatologist Debra Jailman. \u201cIt becomes irritated, red and inflamed because it lacks that barrier, making it more susceptible to irritants.\u201d </span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which is why when it comes to picking the right moisturizer, ingredients matter. Both Peredo and Jailman suggest\u00a0avoiding any moisturizer with fragrance or formaldehyde since they are allergens that can easily irritate sensitive skin.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, look for ingredients that contain anti-inflammatory properties like chamomile and aloe vera. Fatty acids like shea butter and hyaluronic acid, water molecules that bind the skin, are also great for hydration.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, if you\u2019re unsure which moisturizers are best for sensitive skin, you\u2019ve come to the right place. Below, we enlist the help of our shoppers to determine which moisturizers offer the most hydration without irritating sensitive skin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have sensitive skin, the fewer ingredients in your products, the better. Fragrances, drying alcohol and preservatives can all be common irritants for sensitive types. This moisturizer\u2014made with healing thermal spring water\u2014is a lightweight yet deeply hydrating formula with a minimal ingredient list. Its unique airtight packaging allows it to be formulated with zero potentially irritating preservatives.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Why Dermstore shoppers love it:</b>\u00a0\u201cI have very sensitive reactive skin, and this moisturizer has made a huge difference for me,\u201d says one shopper. \u201cThis is my go-to product morning and night! Helps my dryness but doesn\u2019t over-moisturize. Love the packaging too!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This waterless, silicone-based moisturizer contains Dermalogica\u2019s signature UltraCalming Complex (made from oats and other active botanicals), formulated to target exactly what\u2019s causing your skin to get irritated. It also contains an anti-ozonate complex that\u2019s composed of evening primrose oil and emollient silicones to help strengthen your skin\u2019s lipid barrier and withstand irritation in the future.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Why Dermstore shoppers love it:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cMy skin is very easily irritated and this stuff is great!\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cRedness instantly goes away after application.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This gentle cream deeply hydrates while providing instant relief to inflamed, environmentally damaged skin\u2014thanks to its prime ingredient, thermal spring water. This bacteriologically pure water\u00a0has a low mineral content, a large variety of skin-soothing trace elements, and has been proven by more than 150 clinical studies as an effective treatment for skin conditions including atopic dermatitis, rosacea, psoriasis and eczema.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why Dermstore shoppers love it:</strong> \u201cThis moisturizer does not aggravate my highly sensitive skin or cause me to break out,\u201d says one reviewer. \u201cThe formula has a light, creamy consistency, layers well and sinks in without a problem.\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Aside from quenching thirsty skin with shea and mango seed butters, this rich cream helps repair and strengthen your skin barrier with Pro-Niacin, a form of vitamin B-3 that helps <a href=\"https://www.dermstore.com/blog/niacin-skin-benefits/\">stimulate your body\u2019s natural repair system</a>. By helping to create a stronger skin barrier, this moisturizer helps protect your skin from the elements (aka your sensitive skin triggers) while locking in much-needed moisture longer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Why Dermstore shoppers love it:</strong> \u201cI got this as a sample and it was a lifesaver,\u201d raves one reviewer. \u201cI got a large burn on my leg and used this cream. It healed and soothed my skin very quickly and left no scar!\u201d</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This moisturizer is a blend of gentle, all-natural ingredients that not only work to hydrate skin but also to improve its texture. First, the anti-inflammatory properties in meadow-foam and flaxseed soothe the skin from redness irritation.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then the hydration elements of rosehip, safflower and avocado\u2014all rich in fatty acids\u2014work together to improve your skin\u2019s moisture levels and add extra protection against environmental stressors.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Why Dermstore readers love it: </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI love how it melts into my skin leaving it soft, smooth, firm and hydrated,\u201d says one reader. \u201cMy fine lines look more plump. No breakouts or irritation.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A multitasker, this rich face cream brightens, hydrates and provides anti-aging benefits for your skin. It\u2019s all thanks to a combination of botanicals, vitamins and pure molecular oxygen\u2014a key ingredient for collagen production. </span><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1467-2494.1996.tb00143.x\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Studies</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that it improves the skin\u2019s surface and reduces the number of fine lines and wrinkles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This multitasking face cream is a lifesaver for your skin, with two ingredients that help get to the root of your irritation, further preventing sensitivity in the future. The signature CalmPlex has been clinically proven to minimize redness on your skin, plus its B3 ingredient restores your skin\u2019s barrier from environmental stressors.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the word \u201ccalm\u201d literally in the name, you can expect that this moisturizer will help get rid of redness and irritation. \u201cChamomile has very strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties which are particularly soothing for sensitive skin,\u201d says Peredo.
